\section*{Abstract}
The closest galactic center, our very own Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the central 500 pc of the Milky Way), is a powerful laboratory for studying the processes that shape galaxies across cosmic time, from large-scale gas flows and star formation to stellar feedback and interaction with a central supermassive black hole. Research over the last decade has revealed that the process of converting gas into stars in galaxy centers differs from the star formation process in galactic disks. The CMZ is the only such region in which we
can identify and weigh individual forming stars, so it is the key location to
establish the physical laws governing star formation and feedback under the
conditions dominating star formation across cosmic history. Large-scale surveys
of molecular and atomic gas within the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way
($\sim10\degrees$) will require efficient mapping capabilities on single-dish
radio telescopes. Characterizing the detailed star formation process will
require large-scale, high-resolution surveys of the protostellar populations
and small-scale gas structure with dedicated surveys on the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and eventually with the James Webb Space
Telescope, the Next Generation Very Large Array, and the Origins Space
Telescope.

\section{Galactic Center star formation \& feedback: key questions}

%Star formation in the centers of large galaxies like the Milky Way is different from `normal' star formation. % I hate this sentence, will return to it.


Our own Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of our Galaxy) is the closest galactic nucleus, and it is
actively forming stars \citep{Morris1996a}. It is the only location suitable for studying star
formation in hot, turbulent, high-pressure  \citep{Ao2013a, Ginsburg2016a, Krieger2017a}
molecular gas analogous to the environments of high-redshift galaxies
\citep{Kruijssen2013a}, in which most stars formed. The centers of 
galaxies have more scattered efficiencies than their disks
\citep{Leroy2013a,Usero2015a,Bigiel2016a,Gallagher2018a}, suggesting that
galaxy centers undergo episodic cycles of bursty star formation and quiescence
\citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2014c,Krumholz2017a,Torrey2017c,Seo2019a}.
We highlight two overarching questions that we can answer over the next decade:
how is our galactic center fed, and how does it digest gas into stars?
% stars are galaxy poop.


\subsection{How is gas deposited into the Galactic center from the Galactic disk?}
Fresh material arrives to the Galactic center from the disk via the Galactic bar.
Star formation efficiency in the bar is lower than in much of the disk
\citep[e.g.][]{Muraoka2019a,Seo2019a}, therefore, fresh gas can be transported inward.
A growing suite of simulations and analytic models
\citep{Krumholz2015c,Sormani2015a,Torrey2017c,Ridley2017a,Krumholz2017a,Sormani2018a,Jeffreson2018b}
demonstrate that galactic centers vary between brief bursts of star formation and
followed by periods of quiescence given a variety of models of CMZ feeding.  The inner Lindblad resonance provides
a dynamical barrier preventing the gas from moving inward, causing it to build
up at $\sim100$ pc, forming the CMZ \citep{Krumholz2015c}.  Gas transport further
inward, to the nuclear cluster and the central black hole, is presently small
and may be driven primarily by stellar feedback
\citep[e.g.,][]{Davies2007a,Kruijssen2017a,Sormani2018b}. The infall through
the final few parsecs is mediated by the circumnuclear disk \citep[CND;
e.g.,][]{Takekawa2017a,Hsieh2017a}), which contains molecular and ionized gas
at temperatures and densities seen nowhere else in the Galaxy.

Key questions about each step of the above inflow process that can be solved in
the next decade include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\textit{Why is the star formation efficiency low in gas along the bar?}
Very little star formation is currently known in the range $0.1 \mathrm{kpc} <
R_{gal} < 3 \mathrm{kpc}$, yet there is abundant molecular gas emission
\citep[e.g.][]{Dame2001a}.  Apparently, this gas is delivered to the CMZ
with little loss to star formation.  Why is it inefficient
at forming stars until it reaches the Galactic center?  Where is the material
coming from, and how is it deposited on to the CMZ?

% While multi-pixel
% heterodyne arrays are the most efficient way to produce these surveys, large
% time allocations with a single pixel are also viable.

% \agnote{Is it worth mentioning that SEDIGISM has
% is the first step in this direction?  Or better to avoid mentioning an
% EU-centric program...}
%
% \agnote{Should we call out the Chajnator telescope?  LBT?  ARO?  as needing national support?  Maybe we should ask that Green bank be moved to -30 latitude?}

    \item 
\textit{How is gas transported from the CMZ to the central few parsecs?}
After gas is delivered into the CMZ, models suggest that it stops flowing inwards, and instead builds up along orbital pathways until it reaches a critical threshold and begins forming stars
\citep{Kruijssen2014c,Krumholz2017a,Sormani2018b,Jeffreson2018b}.  Shortly
afterward, the feedback from high mass stars may dominate over the gas inflow,
resulting in a net loss of gas from the CMZ.  This feedback drives gas both
inward, toward the central black hole, and vertically outward, producing an
outflow. How much of this gas is turned into stars, how much is driven out of
the Galactic center by feedback, and how much is driven towards the central
black hole?  What processes govern each of these steps? 
\end{enumerate}

Our Galactic center is presently at a low state in both star formation and
accretion onto Sgr A*.  The Fermi bubbles suggest there was much higher
activity in the recent past \citep{Su2010a}, but the present-day
outflow activity is low and consistent with driving mostly by star formation
\citep{Law2009a,Law2010a} with some contribution from Sgr A*'s jet
\citep{Muno2008a,Li2013f,Zhu2018b}. Tracking the present-day gas flow from outside
the CMZ to the central black hole is critical
to understand where gas resides during the low-state in galaxies.

\textit{The key advance needed to measure the lifecycle of gas in the Galactic
center and the feeding of the central black hole is an accurate
three-dimensional model of the central $R<100$ pc.} Significant improvements in
our understanding
of the CMZ's geometry have been made in the last decade, refining the structural
model of the molecular gas from a simple ring to a more realistic and physically
self-consistent set of streams
\citep{Molinari2011a,Kruijssen2015a,Ridley2017a,Sormani2018a,Kruijssen2019b}.
Geometric tests are the most important tool to distinguish
between the competing models.

Detailed observational work testing these models has so far progressed only
piecemeal, with case studies assessing the line-of-sight locations of
individual clouds and streams \citep[e.g.,][]{Henshaw2016a,Butterfield2018a}.
Systematic studies
comparing absorption and emission lines at multiple wavelengths, e.g., using
centimeter-wave absorption lines of molecular species like H$_2$CO, OH,
C$_3$H$_2$ and emission from radio recombination lines, CO, and other bright
molecular transitions in the millimeter range, have the potential to provide
definitive locations of clouds and HII regions and test the theoretical
geometric models.  Assembling a geometric model will require systematic
CMZ-wide (i.e., $\gtrsim2\degrees\times1\degrees$) maps capable of resolving
individual clouds and HII regions ($\lesssim30\arcsec$, $\sim 1\,$pc).  While these
observational goals can be achieved with existing facilities and instruments,
they require substantial time allocations.

Much of the molecular gas along the bar has only been observed at extremely
coarse resolution \citep{Dame2001a}. While these observations are useful for
bulk mass inflow measurements \citep[e.g.,][]{Sormani2019a}, they are
inadequate for measurements of turbulence and star formation. Single-dish
molecular line surveys at moderate ($\sim30\arcsec$) resolution covering the
inner $\sim20\degrees$ of the Galaxy are needed to spatially resolve and measure the turbulent
density and velocity distributions of these clouds. These measurements also
require continued development of the statistical tools to link gas kinematics
and density distributions with the underlying physics
\citep{Koch2017a,Burkhart2018a}.  Observing the gas around the CMZ is essential
for determining how the accretion process, i.e., the intersection of bar and
CMZ orbits, affects the observed geometry and controls the star formation
process.


Multiwavelength observations will add dimensions to the geometric constraints.
The iron K-$\alpha$ lines in the X-ray trace light echoes from individual
high-energy events in the Galactic center, and monitoring and timing these
events can provide direct distance constraints on clouds
\citep[e.g.][]{Clavel2014a,Churazov2017b,Churazov2017a,Terrier2018a}.
Long-term continued access to X-ray imaging and spectroscopy is needed to
continue these light echo experiments, which grow in power and value over time.
Future imaging surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide
detailed, high-resolution extinction maps.  Use of JWST in the Galactic Center
relies on support for high-dynamic-range imaging, wide-area mapping modes.
Localization of the extincted stars to the Galactic center will enable
molecular cloud mapping analogous to those made of the local kiloparsec with,
e.g., Pan-STARRS \citep{Green2015b}.  Wide-area dust emission and spectral line mapping with OST
will probe the structure of, and turbulence in, CMZ clouds.  Polarization mapping will be key to understanding the role of magnetic fields in star formation in this environment.

% I think we need some sort of wrap-up here...
% Cara's suggestion: wrap up w/discussion of relation to other CMZs?


\subsection{How does star formation change in CMZ-like environments?}
The gas conditions in the Galactic center are substantially different from the
rest of the Galaxy.  Most of the gas mass is in a molecular state
\citep[][]{Kennicutt2012a,Mills2017a}, and the temperature in the molecular gas is
several times higher than in disk molecular clouds, particularly at high
densities \citep{Ao2013a,Ginsburg2016a,Krieger2017a}. These conditions more
closely reflect those seen at the peak of the cosmic star formation history,
implying that the CMZ best represents the dominant conditions for star
formation in the Universe \citep{Kruijssen2013a}. There is growing evidence
that the IMF in the Galactic center massive clusters, the
Arches and the Quintuplet, is shallower than the canonical IMF
\citep{Hosek2019a}. The molecular gas in the CMZ forms stars at a much lower
rate than comparable-density gas in the Galactic disk \citep{Longmore2013b},
showing that star formation does not occur at a uniform density threshold
\citep{Rathborne2014b,Kruijssen2014c,Walker2017a,Barnes2017b,Ginsburg2018a}.

The key open questions about star formation in Galactic centers are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What changes in the star formation process under conditions
        of higher temperature and density (and therefore pressure), 
        cosmic and X-ray backgrounds, and stronger magnetic fields?
        Specifically, how do the star formation rate and the initial
        mass function change under these conditions?
    \item How does episodic star formation progress?  Is star formation
        in galactic centers tied to specific spatial or temporal triggers,
        and are these triggers a distinct mode from galactic disk star
        formation?
\end{enumerate}


{\it
The key advance needed to address these questions is a complete census of the
ongoing star formation activity in the CMZ, i.e., identification and measurement
of all embedded protostars.}

High-resolution imaging in the millimeter and submillimeter regime across the
entire CMZ is needed to perform a census of the ongoing star formation.  The
CMZ constitutes the most confused and extincted line of sight in the sky, so
the mid-infrared Spitzer survey has been deeply ineffective at measuring star
formation in this region \citep{Koepferl2015a}. Individual programs have
begun to tally the protostars \citep[Walker et al, in prep, Barnes et al, in
prep]{Ginsburg2018a,Lu2019a} and the SMA has completed a systematic
survey \citep{Battersby2017b}. However, a systematic deep and high-resolution
survey, such as the proposed ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES, PI Longmore) is
needed to directly measure the star formation rate via the counting of
protostellar cores. Such a survey will also provide both the gas density and
kinematic measurements that characterize the turbulence and link the gas and
stars.

% this is just a repeat of section 1
%Connecting the galaxy scales in Section 1 to stellar scales will require
%large-area maps. It remains unclear whether galactic center starbursts are
%driven by a gradual build-up of gas at a galactocentric radius set by the
%rotation curve \citep{Krumholz2015c}, or instead if there are specific temporal
%and spatial triggers for local bursts as large clouds are fed in along the bar
%\citep{Bally2010a,Sormani2018b}. The combination of detailed measurements of
%the star formation efficiency and timescales
%\citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2015a,Barnes2017b,Jeffreson2018b} with large-area
%single-dish maps of both infalling and CMZ material
%\citep[e.g.][]{Sormani2019a} will answer this question.

For the coming decade, ALMA and JWST will be the key instruments for providing
the prestellar and stellar census, respectively, and simultaneously measuring
gas properties.  However, because ALMA is limited to the millimeter regime,
it will have limited accuracy when determining embedded stellar properties because
of dust optical depth in disks; the ngVLA will be required to directly measure
the properties of the most deeply hidden protostars.  JWST will provide both
a census of the young, recently formed stellar population and detailed dust 
extinction maps.  OST will be needed to obtain luminosity measurements of the
most embedded stars and high-resolution maps of dust density.  The key needs
this science program imposes on the space telescopes are mapping speed
and dynamic range; the Galactic Center is full of faint features adjacent
to some of the brightest on the sky, and we need instruments and observing
modes capable of detecting both.


Large-scale mapping of CMZ gas will enable comparison of our Galactic center to
nearby galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{Leroy2018a}.

Recent and ongoing ALMA
surveys are providing tens of parsec-scale observations of nearby galaxies
covering large areas with a few lines (PHANGS-ALMA, Leroy et al.\ to be
submitted) or CMZ-scale areas across the entire millimeter spectrum (ALCHEMI).
Analogous data sets covering our own CMZ are needed to enable the application
of the Galactic work to universal scales.  Surveys of the molecular
chemistry across the CMZ are needed to provide indirect means of understanding
the physical scales that will remain unresolved in external galaxies.

% \section{Text Grab Bag}
% 
% \subsection{Betsy Grant text}
% \noindent{\bf {\em Overview}:} A key area of investigation identified in the
% 2010 Decadal Survey is what goes on in galaxy centers: the interactions
% between stars, black holes and gas. Until recently there has only been one
% galaxy where we can investigate these interactions in detail: the Milky Way,
% an inactive and relatively sedate galaxy. Now however, the capabilities
% offered by ALMA make it possible to conduct detailed comparisons of gas
% properties and interactions in the Milky Way center with those in other
% galaxy centers. We will conduct the {\bf first comparison of gas properties
% on identical, parsec scales in the Milky Way center with those in NGC 253, a
% nearby starburst galaxy}. This project will lead to advances in our
% understanding of accretion and feedback processes, and produce new templates
% for molecular gas properties which can be used to interpret unresolved
% observations of more distant galaxies. 
% \section{Project Description}  
% 
% At just 8 kpc away \citep{Boehle16a}, the center of our Galaxy is relatively
% easy to explore in detail. At this distance, we can pick out massive clusters
% \citep{Clarkson12a,Hussmann12,Lu13}, and their effects on surrounding gas
% \citep{Lang97,Lang01}, and can even pinpoint the existence of a largely
% inactive supermassive black hole \citep{Genzel96,Genzel97,Ghez98,Ghez08}. As
% comprehensive as this view seems, our picture is incomplete: to fully probe
% this environment, we need to examine the molecular gas, the fuel for all
% future activity, at comparable, arcsecond resolution. Newly built and
% upgraded radio/mm interferometers like ALMA and the VLA have finally made
% this possible \citep[e.g.,][]{Mills15, Rathborne15, Battersby2017a}. 
% 
% {\bf However, the problem remains that the Galactic center (GC) is the only
% galaxy nucleus we can explore in detail, and, cosmically speaking, it is
% extremely boring.} Despite hints of past activity \citep{Ponti10,SSF10,SF12},
% the supermassive black hole is currently quiescent, and a sizable central
% reservoir of molecular gas is producing relatively little star formation
% \citep{Longmore13}. We can examine the molecular gas in the GC with exquisite
% resolution, but if mechanisms suspected to drive black hole growth
% \citep[through active accretion from a `torus';][]{LB69,Netzer15}, feedback
% and internal quenching of star formation \citep[either from star formation
% itself or AGN;][]{DS12,DM05} are not currently present, then this scrutiny
% will not yield new insight into these phenomena. %A sample size of one is not
% enough. %%% how the nucleus shapes the evolution of its host galaxy
% \citep{Gebhardt,Ferrarese}
% 
% {\bf We propose to undertake the first detailed comparison of the kinematics
% and excitation of molecular gas in two galaxy nuclei} on identical 2 parsec
% size scales using identical tracers. While our GC is largely inactive, NGC
% 253 is a nuclear starburst with more than an order of magnitude more star
% formation, driving a massive molecular outflow \citep{Bolatto13}. In
% comparing the two, the sedate nature of the GC will make it possible to
% disentangle the feedback effects of a pure starburst \citep[like the GC, the
% black hole at the center of NGC 253 is believed to be
% quiescent;][]{MS10,Lehmer13} from the initial conditions of heating and
% turbulence naturally present in gas falling in to the central gravitational
% potential. 
% 
% Still, present day galaxies like the Milky Way and NGC 253 are far removed
% from the epochs of peak star formation, black hole growth, and quenching
% \citep[z$>$ 1;][]{Madau98, Hasinger05, Whitaker12}.  As we are unlikely to
% ever be able to study distant populations of galaxies with comparable
% resolution or sensitivity, one approach to better understand their ISM
% conditions is to identify local analogs which can then be used as proxies for
% more detailed study. An outcome of this work will be to produce templates for
% the range of molecular line emission and gas properties present in these
% sources that can be compared with newly initiated large surveys of molecular
% gas in local and distant galaxies \citep[e.g., PHANGS and
% ASPECS;][]{Walter16,Leroy16}. 
% 
% Measuring the physical conditions of molecular gas in a galaxy nucleus (e.g.,
% its temperature, density, and turbulence) reveals how the processes in this
% region (e.g. supernovae, AGN) affect the gas reservoir, regulating and
% eventually shutting off star formation. Feedback processes-- such as
% radiative heating from different AGN modes \citep[e.g.,][]{Xie17}, winds
% launched from AGN \citep[e.g.,][]{Yuan16} and energy input from supernovae
% \citep{Efst00} are expected to increase temperature and turbulence of the
% gas, increasing its stability against gravitational collapse. However in the
% GC, gas conditions are notably extreme \citep[T$>$50-400 K, $\sigma>$ 10 km/s
% on 10 pc size scales;][]{Shetty12,Mills13a,Ginsburg16} in the absence of any
% obviously dominant feedback mechanism. 
% 
% Current advances in sensitivity and bandwidth are making it possible not just
% to probe sub-parsec scales, but to survey large areas simultaneously in more
% than a dozen lines \citep[e.g.,][]{Jones12, Jones13, Ginsburg16, Krieger17}.
% With the ability to both survey the multiple square-degree GC region and
% probe down to the arcsecond scales that dissect individual molecular clouds,
% we are now poised to probe gas conditions in the GC over nearly 4 orders of
% magnitude in size scale, from 0.05 to 300 parsec. This allows us to finally
% quantify gas conditions on the scales of local star formation in the GC and
% determine how these would appear when averaged over the entire nucleus of our
% Galaxy (as it would appear when viewed at extragalactic distances).
% 
% As studies begin to target molecular gas in more and more distant sources,
% they will preferentially probe gas in extreme environments of luminous
% sources that are most easily observed at large distances (e.g., submillimeter
% galaxies, mergers, and ULIRGS). Studying more and more extreme local
% environments are therefore necessary to correctly interpret observations of
% individual lines for deriving conditions in more extreme environments of
% high-z galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Swinbank11}.
