  abstract =      {We compare molecular gas traced by 12CO (2-1) maps
                   from the HERACLES survey, with tracers of the recent
                   star formation rate (SFR) across 30 nearby disk
                   galaxies. We demonstrate a first-order linear
                   correspondence between Sigmamol and SigmaSFR but also
                   find important second-order systematic variations in
                   the apparent molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol = \Sigma _mol / \Sigma _SFR. At the 1 kpc
                   common resolution of HERACLES, CO emission correlates
                   closely with many tracers of the recent SFR.
                   Weighting each line of sight equally, using a fixed
                   alphaCO equivalent to the Milky Way value, our data
                   yield a molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol=\Sigma _mol/\Sigma _SFR \approx 2.2 Gyr with
                   0.3 dex 1sigma scatter, in very good agreement with
                   recent literature data. We apply a forward-modeling
                   approach to constrain the power-law index, N, that
                   relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas
                   surface density, \Sigma _SFR \propto \Sigma _mol^N.
                   We find N = 1 $\pm$ 0.15 for our full data set with
                   some scatter from galaxy to galaxy. This also agrees
                   with recent work, but we caution that a power-law
                   treatment oversimplifies the topic given that we
                   observe correlations between \tau _dep^mol and other
                   local and global quantities. The strongest of these
                   are a decreased \tau _dep^mol in low-mass,
                   low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the
                   kpc-scale \tau _dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G.
                   These correlations can be explained by a CO-to-H2
                   conversion factor (alphaCO) that depends on dust
                   shielding, and thus D/G, in the theoretically
                   expected way. This is not a unique interpretation,
                   but external evidence of conversion factor variations
                   makes this the most conservative explanation of the
                   strongest observed \tau _dep^mol trends. After
                   applying a D/G-dependent alphaCO, some weak
                   correlations between \tau _dep^mol and local
                   conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower
                   \tau _dep^mol and enhanced CO excitation associated
                   with nuclear gas concentrations in a subset of our
                   targets. These appear to reflect real enhancements in
                   the rate of star formation per unit gas, and although
                   the distribution of taudep does not appear bimodal in
                   galaxy centers, taudep does appear multivalued at
                   fixed SigmaH2, supporting the idea of "disk" and
                   "starburst" modes driven by other environmental
                   parameters.},

                   regions in the Milky Way (MW) provide the ultimate
                   benchmark for studying star formation. The extent to
                   which the results of these Galaxy-based studies can
                   be extrapolated to extragalactic systems depends on
                   the overlap of the environmental conditions probed.
                   In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds
                   and star-forming regions in the MW with those in
                   nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift Universe. We
                   find that in terms of their baryonic composition,
                   kinematics and densities, the clouds in the solar
                   neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby
                   galaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW
                   are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and
                   galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in
                   the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas
                   represents the initial conditions for high-redshift
                   starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process
                   consistently suppresses star formation over â‰³ 108
                   yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains
                   large reservoirs of gas with properties directly
                   comparable to most of the known range of star
                   formation environments and is therefore an excellent
                   template for studying star formation across
                   cosmological time-scales.},

                   at large and small radii. At intermediate radii
                   shocks arise and the streamlines shift between two

  abstract =      {We examine the stability of feedback-regulated star
                   formation (SF) in galactic nuclei and contrast it to
                   SF in extended discs. In galactic nuclei the
                   dynamical time becomes shorter than the time over
                   which feedback from young stars evolves. We argue
                   analytically that the balance between stellar
                   feedback and gravity is unstable in this regime. We
                   study this using numerical simulations with pc-scale
                   resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from
                   stellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young
                   stellar mass, and SFR within the central ~100 pc (the
                   short-timescale regime) never reach steady-state, but
                   instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles.
                   Stars form until a critical surface density of young
                   stars is present (such that feedback overwhelms
                   gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from
                   the nucleus. Since the dynamical times are shorter
                   than the stellar evolution times, the stars do not
                   die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push,
                   triggering a runaway quenching of star formation in
                   the nucleus. However the expelled gas is largely not
                   unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic
                   fountain which re-fills the nuclear region after the
                   massive stars from the previous burst cycle have died
                   off (~50 Myr timescale). On large scales (>1 kpc),
                   the galaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable.
                   We examine the consequences of this episodic nuclear
                   star formation for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS)
                   relation: while a tight KS relation exists on ~1 kpc
                   scales in good agreement with observations, the
                   scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures

                   formation and winds in the nuclear regions of
                   galaxies, focusing on the Milky Way's Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). In our model angular momentum
                   and mass are transported by a combination of
                   gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities.
                   In gravitationally unstable regions the gas can form
                   stars, and the resulting feedback drives both
                   turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ.
                   We show that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where
                   mass deposited at large radii by the bar is
                   transported inwards to a star-forming, ring-shaped
                   region at Ëœ100 pc from the Galactic Centre, where
                   the shear reaches a minimum. This ring undergoes
                   episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting Ëœ5-10 Myr
                   occurring at Ëœ20-40 Myr intervals. During quiescence
                   the gas in the ring is not fully cleared, but is
                   driven out of a self-gravitating state by the
                   momentum injected by expanding supernova remnants.
                   Starbursts also drive a wind off the star-forming
                   ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to
                   the star formation rate. We show that our model
                   agrees well with the observed properties of the CMZ,
                   and places it near a star formation minimum within
                   the evolutionary cycle. We argue that such cycles of
                   bursty star formation and winds should be ubiquitous
                   in the nuclei of barred spiral galaxies, and show
                   that the resulting distribution of galactic nuclei on
                   the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation is in good agreement

                   distribution of molecular gas in the innermost 300
                   parsecs of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone,
                   is strongly asymmetric. Indeed, approximately three
                   quarters of molecular emission come from positive
                   longitudes, and only one quarter from negative
                   longitudes. However, despite much theoretical effort,
                   the origin of this asymmetry has remained a mystery.
                   Here, we show that the asymmetry can be neatly
                   explained by unsteady flow of gas in a barred
                   potential. We use high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical
                   simulations coupled to a state-of-the-art chemical
                   network. Despite the initial conditions and the bar
                   potential being point symmetric with respect to the
                   Galactic Centre, asymmetries develop spontaneously
                   due to the combination of a hydrodynamical
                   instability known as the `wiggle instability' and the
                   thermal instability. The observed asymmetry must be
                   transient: observations made tens of megayears in the
                   past or in the future would often show an asymmetry
                   in the opposite sense. Fluctuations of amplitude
                   comparable to the observed asymmetry occur for a
                   large fraction of time in our simulations, and
                   suggest that the present is not an exceptional moment
                   in the life of our Galaxy.},

                   based on the large-scale (galactic) dynamics of the
                   interstellar medium. Within this theory, the cloud
                   lifetime is set by the time-scales for gravitational
                   collapse, galactic shear, spiral arm interactions,
                   epicyclic perturbations and cloud-cloud collisions.
                   It is dependent on five observable quantities,
                   accessible through measurements of the galactic
                   rotation curve, the gas and stellar surface
                   densities, and the gas and stellar velocity
                   dispersions of the host galaxy. We determine how the
                   relative importance of each dynamical mechanism
                   varies throughout the space of observable galactic
                   properties, and conclude that gravitational collapse
                   and galactic shear play the greatest role in setting
                   the cloud lifetime for the considered range of galaxy
                   properties, while cloud-cloud collisions exert a much
                   lesser influence. All five environmental mechanisms
                   are nevertheless required to obtain a complete
                   picture of cloud evolution. We apply our theory to
                   the galaxies M31, M51, M83, and the Milky Way, and
                   find a strong dependence of the cloud lifetime upon
                   galactocentric radius in each case, with a typical
                   cloud lifetime between 10 and 50 Myr. Our theory is
                   ideally-suited for systematic observational tests

                   This inflow happens mostly through two symmetrical
                   dust-lanes, similar to those often seen in external
                   barred galaxies. Here we use the fact that the Milky

                   latter shows that the inflow rate is variable with

                   statistical tools developed from methods proposed in
                   the literature. We test whether our methods are
                   sensitive to changes in the underlying physical
                   properties of the clouds or whether their behaviour
                   is governed by random fluctuations. We perform a set
                   of 32 self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic
                   simulations that test all combinations of five
                   physical parameters -- Mach number, plasma parameter,
                   virial parameter, driving scales, and solenoidal
                   driving fraction -- each of which can be set to a low

                   of ${\rm ^{13}CO}$(1-0) emission from each
                   simulation. We compare these mock data to a those

                   pseudo-distance metrics based on 18 different
                   statistical techniques that have previously been used
                   to study molecular clouds. We analyze these results
                   using methods from the statistical field of
                   experimental design and find that several of the
                   statistics can reliably track changes in the
                   underlying physics. Our analysis shows that the
                   interactions between parameters are often among the
                   most significant effects. A small fraction of
                   statistics are also sensitive to changes in magnetic
                   field properties. We use this framework to compare
                   the set of simulations to observations of three
                   nearby star-forming regions: NGC 1333, Oph A, and IC
                   348. We find that no one simulation agrees
                   significantly better with the observations, although
                   there is evidence that the high Mach number
                   simulations are more consistent with the

                   probability distribution function (PDF) of density in
                   giant molecular clouds. This is in contrast to
                   previous analytic SFR models that use purely
                   lognormal density PDFs. Low density gas resides in
                   the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes
                   gravitationally unstable past a critical density
                   ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a power
                   law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the
                   transitional density ($\rho_t$) between the lognormal
                   and power law portions of the PDF moves towards
                   lower-density while the slope of the power law
                   ($\alpha$) becomes increasingly shallow. The star
                   formation rate per free-fall time is calculated via
                   an integral over the lognormal from $\rho_{crit}$ to
                   $\rho_t$ and an integral over the power law from
                   $\rho_t$ to infinity. As $\alpha$ becomes shallower
                   the SFR increases beyond the expected values
                   calculated from a lognormal density PDF. We show that
                   the star formation efficiency per free fall time in
                   local molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF
                   power law slopes, in agreement with our model. The
                   approach presented here yields star formation rates
                   in good agreement with both local GMCs and
                   extragalactic observations. Our model can explain why
                   star formation is spatially and temporally variable
                   within a cloud and can accelerate and why the
                   depletion times observed in local and extragalactic
                   giant molecular clouds vary. Our model can explain
                   both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems
                   without the need to invoke extreme variations in the

                   Galactic center (GC), with a width of about
                   40$\,^{\circ}$ in longitude. The gamma-ray emission
                   associated with these bubbles has a significantly
                   harder spectrum (dN/dE ~ E -2) than the inverse
                   Compton emission from electrons in the Galactic disk,
                   or the gamma rays produced by the decay of pions from
                   proton-interstellar medium collisions. There is no
                   significant spatial variation in the spectrum or
                   gamma-ray intensity within the bubbles, or between
                   the north and south bubbles. The bubbles are
                   spatially correlated with the hard-spectrum microwave
                   excess known as the WMAP haze; the edges of the
                   bubbles also line up with features in the ROSAT X-ray
                   maps at 1.5-2 keV. We argue that these Galactic
                   gamma-ray bubbles were most likely created by some
                   large episode of energy injection in the GC, such as
                   past accretion events onto the central massive black
                   hole, or a nuclear starburst in the last ~10 Myr.
                   Dark matter annihilation/decay seems unlikely to
                   generate all the features of the bubbles and the
                   associated signals in WMAP and ROSAT; the bubbles
                   must be understood in order to use measurements of
                   the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner Galaxy as
                   a probe of dark matter physics. Study of the origin
                   and evolution of the bubbles also has the potential
                   to improve our understanding of recent energetic
                   events in the inner Galaxy and the high-latitude

                   models would require massive energy input (e.g.,

                   single-dish observations of radio recombination lines
                   toward this enigmatic object. The observations find
                   that the ionized gas has a morphology similar to the
                   radio continuum emission, suggesting that they are
                   associated. We study averages of several transitions
                   from H106alpha to H191epsilon and find that the line
                   ratios are most consistent with gas in local
                   thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination
                   line widths are remarkably narrow, constraining the
                   typical electron temperature to be less than about
                   4000 K. These observations also find evidence of
                   pressure broadening in the higher electronic states,
                   implying a gas density of ne = 910+310 -450 cm-3. The

                   appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100
                   parsecs of the galaxy with a mass of roughly 105 M

                   of gas that spans the central degree of our Galaxy.
                   It has been cited as evidence for a mass outflow from
                   our GC region, which has inspired diverse models for
                   its origin. However, most work has focused on the
                   morphology of the GC lobe, which has made it
                   difficult to draw strong conclusions about its
                   nature. Here, I present a coherent, multiwavelength
                   analysis of new and archival observations of the GC
                   lobe. New radio continuum observations show that the
                   entire structure has a similar spectral index,
                   indicating that it has a common origin. The radio
                   continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a
                   magnetized layer with a diameter of 110 pc and an
                   equipartition field strength ranging from 40 to 100
                   muG. I show that optical and radio recombination line
                   emission are associated with the GC lobe and are
                   consistent with being located in the GC region. The
                   recombination line emission traces an ionized shell
                   nested within the radio continuum with diameter of 80
                   pc and height 165 pc. Mid-infrared maps at 8 and 15
                   mum show that the GC lobe has a third layer of warm
                   dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-emission
                   that surrounds the radio continuum shell with a
                   diameter of 130 pc. Assuming adiabatic expansion of
                   the gas in the GC lobe, its formation required an
                   energy input of about 5 Ã— 1052 ergs. I compare the
                   physical conditions of the GC lobe to several models
                   and find best agreement with the canonical starburst
                   outflow model. The formation of the GC lobe is
                   consistent with the currently observed pressure and
                   star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of
                   our Galaxy. Outflows of this scale are more typical
                   of dwarf galaxies and would not be easily detected in
                   nearby spiral galaxies. Thus, the existence of such
                   an outflow in our own Galaxy may indicate that it is
                   a relatively common phenomenon in the nuclei of
                   spiral galaxies.},

  abstract =      {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential
                   of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky
                   Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics,
                   potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence
                   of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
                   orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the
                   CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in
                   the empirically constrained gravitational potential
                   and represents a good fit (chi _red^2=2.0) to the
                   observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n >
                   several 103 cm-3) gas, reproducing all of its key
                   properties. The orbit is also consistent with
                   observational constraints not included in the fitting
                   process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2
                   and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs
                   from previous, parametric models in several respects:
                   (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the
                   extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its
                   orbital velocity (100-200 km s-1) is twice as high as
                   in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the
                   focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
                   offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently
                   proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between
                   G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an
                   absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of
                   which the condensation was triggered by the tidal
                   compression during their most recent pericentre
                   passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
                   and find that their pericentre passages occurred
                   0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times
                   (tff Ëœ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016
                   and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are
                   separated by a single free-fall time of evolution,
                   implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once
                   collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete
                   orbital solution, as well as several quantitative
                   predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the
                   positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is
                   concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and
                   possible caveats, as well as the position of the
                   model in the Galactic context, highlighting its
                   relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics
                   of the bar, the x2 orbital family, and the origin of
                   the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.},

                   clouds along the same line-of-sight, are physically
                   connected in position--velocity space via a third
                   southern component around 50 km s-1. Further
                   position--velocity analysis of the surrounding
                   region, using lower-resolution survey observations
                   taken with the Mopra and ATCA telescopes, indicates
                   that both molecular components in M0.20-0.033 are
                   physically connected to the M0.10-0.08 molecular
                   cloud, which is suggested to be located on stream 1
                   in the Kruijssen et al. orbital model. The morphology
                   and kinematics of the molecular gas in M0.20-0.033
                   indicate that the two velocity components in
                   M0.20-0.033 constitute an expanding shell. Our
                   observations suggest that the M0.20-0.033 expanding
                   shell has an expansion velocity of 40 km s-1, with a
                   systemic velocity of 53 km s-1, comparable to
                   velocities detected in M0.10-0.08. The origin of the
                   expanding shell is located near the Quintuplet
                   cluster, suggesting that the energy and momentum
                   output from this massive stellar cluster may have
                   contributed to the expansion.},

                   cores, HCN 1-0 is well correlated with dense gas mass
                   when plotted as a log-log relationship. There is
                   Ëœ0.75 dex of scatter in this relationship from
                   clouds like Sgr B2, which has an integrated HCN 1-0
                   intensity of a cloud less than half its mass, and
                   others that have HCN 1-0 enhanced by a factor of 2-3
                   relative to clouds of comparable mass. We identify
                   the two primary sources of scatter to be
                   self-absorption and variations in HCN abundance. We
                   also find that the extended HCN 1-0 emission is more
                   intense per unit mass than in individual cloud cores.
                   In fact the majority (80%) of HCN 1-0 emission comes
                   from extended gas with column densities below 7 Ã—

                   However, the observed order of magnitude HCN
                   abundance variations, and the systematic nature of
                   these variations, warn of potential biases in the use
                   of HCN as dense gas mass tracer in more extreme
                   environments such as an active galactic nucleus and
                   shock-dominated regions. We also investigate other 3
                   mm tracers, finding that HNCO is better correlated
                   with mass than HCN, and might be a better tracer of

                   the Galactic plane with a linear resolution of 1.2pc.
                   The strongest of the three lines, the H2CO (303 -->
                   202) transition, is found to be widespread, and its
                   emission shows a spatial distribution similar to
                   ammonia. The relative abundance of para-H2CO is 0.5 -
                   1.2 Ã— 10-9, which is consistent with results from
                   lower frequency H2CO absorption lines. Derived gas
                   kinetic temperatures for individual molecular clouds
                   range from 50K to values in excess of 100K. While a
                   systematic trend toward (decreasing) kinetic
                   temperature versus (increasing) angular distance from
                   the Galactic center (GC) is not found, the clouds
                   with highest temperature (Tkin > 100K) are all
                   located near the nucleus. For the molecular gas
                   outside the dense clouds, the average kinetic
                   temperature is 65 $\pm$ 10K. The high temperatures of
                   molecular clouds on large scales in the GC region may
                   be driven by turbulent energy dissipation and/or
                   cosmic-rays instead of photons. Such a
                   non-photon-driven thermal state of the molecular gas

  abstract =      {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region
                   where we can study star formation under extreme
                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   at Ëœ0.9 pc spatial and Ëœ2.0 km s-1 spectral

                   Sgr B2. We focus on the hyperfine structure of the
                   metastable ammonia inversion lines (J, K) = (1,
                   1)-(6, 6) to derive column density, kinematics,
                   opacity, and kinetic gas temperature. In the CMZ
                   molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of 8-16
                   km s-1 and extended regions of optically thick (tau >

                   are detected at 25-50 K and 60-100 K, both being
                   significantly hotter than the dust temperatures
                   throughout the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of
                   the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in the context of
                   the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. that interprets
                   the observed distribution as a stream of molecular
                   clouds following an open eccentric orbit. This allows
                   us to statistically investigate the time dependencies
                   of gas temperature, column density, and line width.
                   We find heating rates between Ëœ50 and Ëœ100 K Myr-1
                   along the stream orbit. No strong signs of time
                   dependence are found for column density or line
                   width. These quantities are likely dominated by
                   cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results qualitatively
                   match the predictions of the current model of tidal
                   triggering of cloud collapse, orbital kinematics, and
                   the observation of an evolutionary sequence of

                   Zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the
                   stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the extreme
                   Galactic Center environment. We use multi-epoch
                   Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain
                   high-precision proper motion and photometric
                   measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster
                   membership probabilities for stars down to 1.8
                   M$_{\odot}$ between cluster radii of 0.25 pc -- 3.0
                   pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just ~8% field
                   contamination, a significant improvement over
                   photometrically-selected samples which are severely
                   compromised by the differential extinction across the
                   field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy
                   of 5 cluster members, we forward model the Arches
                   cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other
                   properties (such as age and total mass) while
                   accounting for observational uncertainties,
                   completeness, mass segregation, and stellar
                   multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best
                   described by a 1-segment power law that is
                   significantly top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.03
                   (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys), where dN/dm $\propto$
                   m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment
                   power law model with a high-mass slope only slightly
                   shallower than local star forming regions ($\alpha$ =
                   2.10 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02) but with a break at
                   5.16$^{+1.25}_{-0.65}$ $\pm$ 0.08 M$_{\odot}$. In
                   either case, the Arches IMF is significantly
                   different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches
                   to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we
                   find tentative evidence for a systematically
                   top-heavy IMF at the Galactic Center.},

                   process in astrophysics and cosmology. Stars are
                   known to form from the gravitational collapse of
                   dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it
                   has been proposed that the resulting star formation
                   rate is proportional to either the amount of mass
                   above a threshold gas surface density, or the gas
                   volume density. These star formation prescriptions
                   appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our
                   Milky Way Galaxy's disc as well as in distant
                   galaxies where the star formation rates are often
                   much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the
                   Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest
                   concentration of dense, high-surface density
                   molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an
                   environment where the validity of star formation
                   prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show that by
                   several measures, the current star formation rate in
                   the CMZ is an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates
                   predicted by the currently accepted prescriptions. In
                   particular, the region 1$\,^{\circ}$ < l <

                   M&sun; of dense (> several 103 cm-3) molecular gas -
                   enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the
                   present-day star formation rate within this gas is
                   only equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to
                   density, another property of molecular clouds must be
                   included in the star formation prescription to
                   predict the star formation rate in a given mass of
                   molecular gas. We discuss which physical mechanisms
                   might be responsible for suppressing star formation

                   calibrated in the disc of our own and nearby
                   galaxies. Understanding how and why star formation
                   appears to be different in this region is crucial if
                   we are to understand the environmental dependence of
                   the star formation process. Here, we present the
                   detection of a sample of high-mass cores in the CMZ's
                   "dust ridge" that have been discovered with the
                   Submillimeter Array as part of the CMZoom survey.
                   These cores range in mass from ~ 50 - 2150 Msun
                   within radii of 0.1 - 0.25 pc. All appear to be young
                   (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are prime candidates
                   for representing the initial conditions of high-mass
                   stars and sub-clusters. We report that at least two
                   of these cores ('c1' and 'e1') contain young,
                   high-mass protostars. We compare all of the detected
                   cores with high-mass cores in the Galactic disc and
                   find that they are broadly similar in terms of their
                   masses and sizes, despite being subjected to external
                   pressures that are several orders of magnitude
                   greater - ~ 10^8 K/cm^3, as opposed to ~ 10^5 K/cm^3.
                   The fact that > 80% of these cores do not show any
                   signs of star-forming activity in such a
                   high-pressure environment leads us to conclude that
                   this is further evidence for an increased critical
                   density threshold for star formation in the CMZ due
                   to turbulence.},

                   cosmic ray ionization rate orders of magnitude higher
                   than the disc; akin to the environment found in
                   star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Previous
                   studies have shown that this region is forming stars
                   at a rate per unit mass of dense gas which is at
                   least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc,
                   potentially violating theoretical predictions. We
                   show that all observational star formation rate
                   diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar
                   objects and integrated light measurements - are in
                   agreement within a factor two, hence the low star
                   formation rate (SFR) is not the result of the
                   systematic uncertainties that affect any one method.
                   As these methods trace the star formation over
                   different time-scales, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, we conclude
                   that the SFR has been constant to within a factor of
                   a few within this time period. We investigate the
                   progression of star formation within gravitationally
                   bound clouds on ~parsec scales and find 1-4 per cent
                   of the cloud masses are converted into stars per
                   free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the
                   considered 'volumetric' star formation models.
                   However, discriminating between these models is
                   obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input
                   observables and, most importantly and urgently, by
                   their dependence on ill-constrained free parameters.
                   The lack of empirical constraints on these parameters
                   therefore represents a key challenge in the further
                   verification or falsification of current star
                   formation theories.},

                   at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources,
                   most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out
                   alternative possibilities, we conclude that these
                   sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions
                   and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly
                   detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that,
                   based on their luminosities, must contain objects
                   with stellar masses {M}* â‰³ 8 {M}o . Their spatial
                   distribution spread over a ~12 Ã— 3 pc region
                   demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended
                   star formation event, not just an isolated
                   ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using
                   this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds
                   and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of
                   the YSOs reside in regions of high column density
                   (N({{{H}}}2)â‰³ 2Ã— {10}23 {{cm}}-2), not all regions
                   of high column density contain YSOs. The observed
                   column density threshold for star formation is
                   substantially higher than that in solar vicinity
                   clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation
                   requires a higher column density or that any star
                   formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in
                   nearby clouds. The relation between the surface
                   density of gas and stars is incompatible with
                   extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar
                   densities in Sgr B2 follow a linear {{{Sigma }}}*
                   {--}{{{Sigma }}}{gas} relation, shallower than that
                   observed in local clouds. Together, these points
                   suggest that a higher volume density threshold is
                   required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.},

  abstract =      {The inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way, the
                   Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), is our closest
                   laboratory for understanding star formation in the
                   extreme environments (hot, dense, turbulent gas) that
                   once dominated the universe. We present an update on
                   the first large-area survey to expose the sites of
                   star formation across the CMZ at high-resolution in
                   submillimeter wavelengths: the CMZoom survey with the
                   Submillimeter Array (SMA). We identify the locations
                   of dense cores and search for signatures of embedded
                   star formation. CMZoom is a three-year survey in its
                   final year and is mapping out the highest column
                   density regions of the CMZ in dust continuum and a
                   variety of spectral lines around 1.3 mm. CMZoom
                   combines SMA compact and subcompact configurations
                   with single-dish data from BGPS and the APEX
                   telescope, achieving an angular resolution of about
                   4" (0.2 pc) and good image fidelity up to large
                   spatial scales.},
