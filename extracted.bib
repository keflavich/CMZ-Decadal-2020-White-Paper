                   harbors a variety of phenomena unique to the central
                   environment. This review discusses the observed
                   structure and activity of the interstellar medium in
                   this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward
                   the center of the Galactic gravitational potential
                   well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a
                   strong concentration of gas into a "Central Molecular
                   Zone" of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular
                   medium is characterized by large densities, large
                   velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and
                   apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state
                   of the gas and the resultant star formation processes
                   occurring in this environment are therefore quite
                   unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas
                   not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X
                   ray-emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven
                   galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably
                   discontinuously, through the domain of the few
                   parsec-sized circumnuclear disks and eventually into
                   the central parsec. There, the central radio source
                   SgrA* currently accepts only a tiny fraction of the
                   inflowing material, likely as a result of a limit
                   cycle wherein the continual inflow of matter provokes
                   star formation, which in turn can temporarily halt
                   the inflow via mass-outflow winds.},

                   telescope to observe the JKAKc = 303 --> 202, 322 -->
                   221, and 321 --> 220 transitions of para-H2CO at
                   218GHz simultaneously to determine kinetic
                   temperatures of the dense gas in the central
                   molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. The map extends
                   over approximately 40' × 8' (~100 × 20pc2) along
                   the Galactic plane with a linear resolution of 1.2pc.
                   The strongest of the three lines, the H2CO (303 -->
                   202) transition, is found to be widespread, and its
                   emission shows a spatial distribution similar to
                   ammonia. The relative abundance of para-H2CO is 0.5 -
                   1.2 × 10-9, which is consistent with results from
                   lower frequency H2CO absorption lines. Derived gas
                   kinetic temperatures for individual molecular clouds
                   range from 50K to values in excess of 100K. While a
                   systematic trend toward (decreasing) kinetic
                   temperature versus (increasing) angular distance from
                   the Galactic center (GC) is not found, the clouds
                   with highest temperature (Tkin > 100K) are all
                   located near the nucleus. For the molecular gas
                   outside the dense clouds, the average kinetic
                   temperature is 65 $\pm$ 10K. The high temperatures of
                   molecular clouds on large scales in the GC region may
                   be driven by turbulent energy dissipation and/or
                   cosmic-rays instead of photons. Such a
                   non-photon-driven thermal state of the molecular gas
                   provides an excellent template for the more distant

  abstract =      {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region
                   where we can study star formation under extreme
                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   GHz obtained at the Australia Telescope Compact Array
                   at ˜0.9 pc spatial and ˜2.0 km s-1 spectral
                   resolution. In this paper, we present data on the
                   inner ˜250 pc (1.$\,^{\circ}$4) between Sgr C and
                   Sgr B2. We focus on the hyperfine structure of the
                   metastable ammonia inversion lines (J, K) = (1,
                   1)-(6, 6) to derive column density, kinematics,
                   opacity, and kinetic gas temperature. In the CMZ
                   molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of 8-16
                   km s-1 and extended regions of optically thick (tau >
                   1) emission. Two components in kinetic temperature
                   are detected at 25-50 K and 60-100 K, both being
                   significantly hotter than the dust temperatures
                   throughout the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of
                   the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in the context of
                   the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. that interprets
                   the observed distribution as a stream of molecular
                   clouds following an open eccentric orbit. This allows
                   us to statistically investigate the time dependencies
                   of gas temperature, column density, and line width.
                   We find heating rates between ˜50 and ˜100 K Myr-1
                   along the stream orbit. No strong signs of time
                   dependence are found for column density or line
                   width. These quantities are likely dominated by
                   cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results qualitatively
                   match the predictions of the current model of tidal
                   triggering of cloud collapse, orbital kinematics, and
                   the observation of an evolutionary sequence of

                   regions in the Milky Way (MW) provide the ultimate
                   benchmark for studying star formation. The extent to
                   which the results of these Galaxy-based studies can
                   be extrapolated to extragalactic systems depends on
                   the overlap of the environmental conditions probed.
                   In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds
                   and star-forming regions in the MW with those in
                   nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift Universe. We
                   find that in terms of their baryonic composition,
                   kinematics and densities, the clouds in the solar
                   neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby
                   galaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW
                   are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and
                   galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in
                   the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas
                   represents the initial conditions for high-redshift
                   starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process
                   consistently suppresses star formation over ≳ 108
                   yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains
                   large reservoirs of gas with properties directly
                   comparable to most of the known range of star
                   formation environments and is therefore an excellent
                   template for studying star formation across

                   star formation rate (SFR) across 30 nearby disk
                   galaxies. We demonstrate a first-order linear
                   correspondence between Sigmamol and SigmaSFR but also
                   find important second-order systematic variations in
                   the apparent molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol = \Sigma _mol / \Sigma _SFR. At the 1 kpc
                   common resolution of HERACLES, CO emission correlates
                   closely with many tracers of the recent SFR.
                   Weighting each line of sight equally, using a fixed
                   alphaCO equivalent to the Milky Way value, our data
                   yield a molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol=\Sigma _mol/\Sigma _SFR \approx 2.2 Gyr with
                   0.3 dex 1sigma scatter, in very good agreement with
                   recent literature data. We apply a forward-modeling
                   approach to constrain the power-law index, N, that
                   relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas
                   surface density, \Sigma _SFR \propto \Sigma _mol^N.
                   We find N = 1 $\pm$ 0.15 for our full data set with
                   some scatter from galaxy to galaxy. This also agrees
                   with recent work, but we caution that a power-law
                   treatment oversimplifies the topic given that we
                   observe correlations between \tau _dep^mol and other
                   local and global quantities. The strongest of these
                   are a decreased \tau _dep^mol in low-mass,
                   low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the
                   kpc-scale \tau _dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G.
                   These correlations can be explained by a CO-to-H2
                   conversion factor (alphaCO) that depends on dust
                   shielding, and thus D/G, in the theoretically
                   expected way. This is not a unique interpretation,
                   but external evidence of conversion factor variations
                   makes this the most conservative explanation of the
                   strongest observed \tau _dep^mol trends. After
                   applying a D/G-dependent alphaCO, some weak
                   correlations between \tau _dep^mol and local
                   conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower
                   \tau _dep^mol and enhanced CO excitation associated
                   with nuclear gas concentrations in a subset of our
                   targets. These appear to reflect real enhancements in
                   the rate of star formation per unit gas, and although
                   the distribution of taudep does not appear bimodal in
                   galaxy centers, taudep does appear multivalued at
                   fixed SigmaH2, supporting the idea of "disk" and
                   "starburst" modes driven by other environmental
                   parameters.},

  abstract =      {We present a new survey of HCN(1-0) emission, a
                   tracer of dense molecular gas, focused on the
                   little-explored regime of normal star-forming galaxy
                   disks. Combining HCN, CO, and infrared (IR) emission,
                   we investigate the role of dense gas in star
                   formation, finding systematic variations in both the
                   apparent dense gas fraction (traced by the HCN-to-CO
                   ratio) and the apparent star formation efficiency of
                   dense gas (traced by the IR-to-HCN ratio). The latter
                   may be unexpected, given the recent popularity of gas
                   density threshold models to explain star formation
                   scaling relations. Our survey used the IRAM 30 m
                   telescope to observe HCN(1-0), CO(1-0), and several
                   other emission lines across 29 nearby disk galaxies
                   whose CO(2-1) emission has previously been mapped by
                   the HERACLES survey. We detected HCN in 48 out of 62
                   observed positions. Because our observations achieve
                   a typical resolution of ˜1.5 kpc and span a range of
                   galaxies and galactocentric radii (56% lie at
                   {r}{gal}\gt 1 kpc), we are able to investigate the
                   properties of the dense gas as a function of local
                   conditions in a galaxy disk. We focus on how the
                   ratios IR-to-CO, HCN-to-CO, and IR-to-HCN
                   (observational cognates of the star formation
                   efficiency, dense gas fraction, and dense gas star
                   formation efficiency) depend on the stellar surface
                   density, {{{Sigma }}}{star}, and the
                   molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, {{{Sigma
                   }}}{mol}/{{{Sigma }}}{atom}. The HCN-to-CO ratio is
                   low, often ˜1/30, and correlates tightly with both
                   the molecular-to-atomic ratio and the stellar mass
                   surface density across a range of 2.1 dex (factor of
                   ≈125) in both parameters. Thus for the assumption
                   of fixed CO-to-H2 and HCN-to-dense gas conversion
                   factors, the dense gas fraction depends strongly on
                   location in the disk, being higher in the high
                   surface density, highly molecular parts of galaxies.
                   At the same time, the IR-to-HCN ratio (closely
                   related to the star formation efficiency of dense
                   molecular gas) decreases systematically with these
                   same parameters and is ˜6-8 times lower near galaxy
                   centers than in the outer regions of the galaxy
                   disks. For fixed conversion factors, these results
                   are incompatible with a simple model in which star
                   formation depends only on the amount of gas mass
                   above some density threshold. Moreover, only a very
                   specific set of environment-dependent conversion
                   factors can render our observations compatible with
                   such a model. Whole cloud models, such as the theory
                   of turbulence regulated star formation, do a better
                   job of matching our observations. We explore one such
                   model in which variations in the Mach number drive
                   many of the trends within galaxy disks, while density
                   contrasts drive the differences between disk and
                   merging galaxies. Based on observations with the IRAM

                   nearby star-forming galaxies. Here, we present new
                   maps of the 3 mm transitions of HCN, HCO+, and HNC
                   across the whole disk of our pilot target, M51. As
                   expected, dense gas correlates with tracers of recent
                   star formation, filling the ``luminosity gap''
                   between Galactic cores and whole galaxies. In detail,
                   we show that both the fraction of gas that is dense,

                   dense gas forms stars, {{SFE}}{dense} traced by

                   sense of the dependence is that high-surface-density,

                   show high dense gas fractions and low dense gas star

                   our own Solar Neighborhood with the central regions
                   of the Milky Way. The sense of the trends can be
                   explained if the dense gas fraction tracks
                   interstellar pressure but star formation occurs only
                   in regions of high density contrast.},

                   Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central 500 pc) of the
                   Milky Way is lower by a factor of >=10 than expected
                   for the substantial amount of dense gas it contains,
                   which challenges current star formation theories. In
                   this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms
                   could be responsible. On scales larger than the disc
                   scaleheight, the low SFR is found to be consistent
                   with episodic star formation due to secular
                   instabilities or possibly variations of the gas
                   inflow along the Galactic bar. The CMZ is marginally
                   Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but
                   highly Toomre-stable when only accounting for the
                   gas, indicating a low condensation rate of
                   self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find
                   that the SFR in the CMZ may be caused by an elevated
                   critical density for star formation due to the high
                   turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal
                   density threshold for star formation is ruled out.
                   The H I-H2 phase transition of hydrogen, the tidal
                   field, a possible underproduction of massive stars
                   due to a bottom-heavy initial mass function, magnetic
                   fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure feedback
                   also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We
                   propose a self-consistent cycle of star formation in
                   the CMZ, in which the effects of several different
                   processes combine to inhibit star formation. The
                   rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas
                   towards collapse - once star formation is initiated
                   it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star
                   formation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central
                   SFR should be a common phenomenon in other galaxies.
                   We discuss the implications for galactic-scale star
                   formation and supermassive black hole growth, and
                   relate our results to the star formation conditions

                   formation and winds in the nuclear regions of
                   galaxies, focusing on the Milky Way's Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). In our model angular momentum
                   and mass are transported by a combination of
                   gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities.
                   In gravitationally unstable regions the gas can form
                   stars, and the resulting feedback drives both
                   turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ.
                   We show that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where
                   mass deposited at large radii by the bar is
                   transported inwards to a star-forming, ring-shaped
                   region at ˜100 pc from the Galactic Centre, where
                   the shear reaches a minimum. This ring undergoes
                   episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting ˜5-10 Myr
                   occurring at ˜20-40 Myr intervals. During quiescence
                   the gas in the ring is not fully cleared, but is
                   driven out of a self-gravitating state by the
                   momentum injected by expanding supernova remnants.
                   Starbursts also drive a wind off the star-forming
                   ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to
                   the star formation rate. We show that our model
                   agrees well with the observed properties of the CMZ,
                   and places it near a star formation minimum within
                   the evolutionary cycle. We argue that such cycles of

  abstract =      {We examine the stability of feedback-regulated star
                   formation (SF) in galactic nuclei and contrast it to
                   SF in extended discs. In galactic nuclei, the orbital
                   time becomes shorter than the time over which
                   feedback from young stars evolves. We argue
                   analytically that traditional feedback-regulated SF
                   equilibrium models break down in the regime. We study
                   this using numerical simulations with the pc-scale
                   resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from
                   stellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young
                   stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) within the
                   central ˜100 pc (the short-time-scale regime) never
                   reach steady state, but instead go through dramatic,
                   oscillatory cycles. Stars form until a critical
                   surface density of young stars is present (where
                   feedback overwhelms gravity), at which point they
                   expel gas from the nucleus. Since the dynamical times
                   are shorter than the stellar evolution times, the
                   stars do not die as the gas is expelled, but continue
                   to push, triggering a runaway quenching of SF in the
                   nucleus. However, the expelled gas is largely not
                   unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic
                   fountain that re-fills the nuclear region after the
                   massive stars from the previous burst cycle have died
                   off (˜50-Myr time-scale). On large scales (>1 kpc),
                   the galaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable.
                   We examine the consequences of this episodic nuclear
                   SF for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation: While a
                   tight KS relation exists on ˜1-kpc scales, the
                   scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures
                   centred on galactic nuclei.},

                   Way-sized, isolated disk galaxies to study the
                   formation and evolution of a stellar bar as well as a
                   nuclear ring in the presence of gas. We consider two
                   sets of models with cold or warm disks that differ in
                   the radial velocity dispersions, and vary the gas
                   fraction f gas by fixing the total disk mass. A bar
                   forms earlier and more strongly in the cold disks
                   with larger f gas, while gas progressively delays the
                   bar formation in the warm disks. The bar formation
                   enhances a central mass concentration, which in turn
                   causes the bar to decay temporarily, after which it
                   regrows in size and strength, eventually becoming
                   stronger in models with smaller f gas. Although all
                   bars rotate fast in the beginning, they rapidly turn
                   to slow rotators. In our models, only the gas-free,
                   warm disk undergoes rapid buckling instability, while
                   other disks thicken more gradually via vertical
                   heating. The gas driven inward by the bar potential
                   readily forms a star-forming nuclear ring. The ring
                   is very small when it first forms and grows in size
                   over time. The ring star formation rate is episodic
                   and bursty due to feedback, and is well correlated
                   with the mass inflow rate to the ring. Some expanding
                   shells produced by star formation feedback are
                   sheared out in the bar regions and collide with dust
                   lanes to appear as filamentary interbar spurs. The
                   bars and nuclear rings formed in our simulations have
                   properties similar to those in the Milky Way.},

                   i.e. the central few hundred pc) as a case study. We
                   show that, in the presence of a galactic bar, gas in
                   a disc in the central regions of a galaxy will be
                   driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced
                   by acoustic instabilities within the bar's inner
                   Lindblad resonance. This transport process drives
                   turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it
                   strongly gravitationally stable and prevents the
                   onset of rapid star formation. However, at some point
                   the rotation curve must transition from approximately
                   flat to approximately solid body, and the resulting
                   reduction in shear reduces the transport rates and
                   causes gas to build up, eventually producing a
                   gravitationally unstable region that is subject to
                   rapid and violent star formation. For the observed
                   rotation curve of the Milky Way, the accumulation
                   happens ˜100 pc from the centre of the Galaxy, in
                   good agreement with the observed location of gas
                   clouds and young star clusters in the CMZ. The
                   characteristic time-scale for gas accumulation and
                   star formation is of the order of 10-20 Myr. We argue
                   that similar phenomena should be ubiquitous in other
                   barred spiral galaxies.},

                   at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby
                   galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H
                   I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the
                   BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 mum data from the
                   Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy
                   Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies
                   and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how
                   the star formation law differs between the H2
                   dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I
                   dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf
                   galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with
                   index N = 1.0 ¬$\pm$ 0.2 relates SigmaSFR and
                   SigmaH2 across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e.,
                   that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in
                   spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is
                   ~2 √{\'o} 109 years. The range of SigmaH2 over
                   which we measure this relation is ~3-50 M sun pc-2,
                   significantly lower than in starburst environments.
                   We find the same results when performing a
                   pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or
                   when varying the star formation tracer used. We
                   interpret the linear relation and constant depletion
                   time as evidence that stars are forming in giant
                   molecular clouds with approximately uniform
                   properties and that SigmaH2 may be more a measure of
                   the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than
                   changing conditions in the molecular gas. The
                   relationship between total gas surface density
                   (Sigmagas) and SigmaSFR varies dramatically among and
                   within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or
                   no correlation between SigmaHI and SigmaSFR. As a
                   result, the star formation efficiency (SFE),
                   SigmaSFR/Sigmagas, varies strongly across our sample
                   and within individual galaxies. We show that this
                   variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE
                   being set by local environmental factors: in spirals
                   the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the
                   dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to
                   those found in the outer optical disks of the
                   spirals. We attribute the similarity to common
                   environments (low density, low metallicity, H I
                   dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically
                   absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition
                   to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature
                   of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface
                   densities at SigmaHI ‚{\^a}{\`a} 9 M sun pc-2 in
                   both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of
                   the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit
                   to be molecular.},

                   mass versus star formation rate (SFR) plane, both for
                   the integrated quantities and for the respective
                   surface densities. This result is based on carbon
                   monoxide (CO) observations of galaxy populations at
                   low and high redshifts, and on the current consensus
                   for the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factors.
                   The data suggest the existence of two different SF
                   regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more
                   rapid mode for starbursts, the latter probably
                   occurring during major mergers or in dense nuclear SF
                   regions. Both modes are observable over a large range
                   of SFRs. The detection of CO emission from distant
                   near-IR selected galaxies reveals such bimodal
                   behavior for the first time, as they allow us to
                   probe gas in disk galaxies with much higher SFRs than
                   are seen locally. The different regimes can
                   potentially be interpreted as the effect of a
                   top-heavy initial mass function in starbursts.
                   However, we favor a different physical origin related
                   to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds. The
                   IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the SF
                   efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to
                   the dynamical (rotation) timescale. Only when
                   accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal
                   SF law is obtained, suggesting a direct link between
                   global galaxy properties and the local SFR.},

                   with Leroy et al. 2008 if we consider the
                   contribution of helium to the molecular gas mass
                   evaluation and the difference in the assumed initial
                   mass function between two studies. We compared SFE
                   among different morphological (i.e., SA, SAB, and SB)
                   types, and found that SFE within the inner radii
                   ($r/r_{25} < 0.3$, where $r_{25}$ is $B$-band
                   isophotal radius at 25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$) of SB
                   galaxies is slightly higher than that of SA and SAB
                   galaxies. This trend can be partly explained by the
                   dependence of SFE on global stellar mass, which
                   probably relates to the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor
                   through the metallicity. For two representative SB
                   galaxies in our sample, NGC 3367 and NGC 7479, the
                   ellipse of $r/r_{25}$ = 0.3 seems to cover not only
                   the central region but also the inner part of the
                   disk, mainly the bar. These two galaxies show higher
                   SFE in the bar than in spiral arms. However, we found
                   an opposite trend in NGC 4303; SFE is lower in the
                   bar than in spiral arms, which is consistent with
                   earlier studies (e.g., Momose et al. 2010). These
                   results suggest diversity of star formation
                   activities in the bar.},

                   at large and small radii. At intermediate radii
                   shocks arise and the streamlines shift between two

                   shocks appear and the streamlines shift between orbit

                   parsecs of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone,
                   is strongly asymmetric. Indeed, approximately three
                   quarters of molecular emission come from positive
                   longitudes, and only one quarter from negative
                   longitudes. However, despite much theoretical effort,
                   the origin of this asymmetry has remained a mystery.
                   Here, we show that the asymmetry can be neatly
                   explained by unsteady flow of gas in a barred
                   potential. We use high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical

                   suggest that the present is not an exceptional moment

                   dependent molecular cloud lifetimes to the Central
                   Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. Within this theory,
                   the cloud lifetime in the Galactic Centre is obtained
                   by combining the time-scales for gravitational
                   instability, galactic shear, epicyclic perturbations,
                   and cloud-cloud collisions. We find that at
                   galactocentric radii ˜45-120 pc, corresponding to
                   the location of the `100-pc stream', cloud evolution
                   is primarily dominated by gravitational collapse,
                   with median cloud lifetimes between 1.4 and 3.9 Myr.
                   At all other galactocentric radii, galactic shear
                   dominates the cloud lifecycle, and we predict that
                   molecular clouds are dispersed on time-scales between
                   3 and 9 Myr, without a significant degree of star
                   formation. Along the outer edge of the 100-pc stream,
                   between radii of 100 and 120 pc, the time-scales for
                   epicyclic perturbations and gravitational free-fall
                   are similar. This similarity of time-scales lends
                   support to the hypothesis that, depending on the
                   orbital geometry and timing of the orbital phase,
                   cloud collapse and star formation in the 100-pc
                   stream may be triggered by a tidal compression at
                   pericentre. Based on the derived time-scales, this
                   should happen in approximately 20 per cent of all
                   accretion events on to the 100-pc stream.},

                   spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
                   typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs.
                   In two cases there is unambiguous kinematic evidence
                   for stellar disks on these scales. In the nuclear
                   regions there appear to have been recent, but no
                   longer active, starbursts in the last 10-300 Myr. The
                   stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the
                   AGN in the central 10 pc, whereas on kiloparsec
                   scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface
                   stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in
                   all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii
                   up to ~1013 Lsolar kpc-2 in the central few parsecs,
                   where the mass surface density exceeds 104 Msolar
                   pc-2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington
                   limited and hence inevitably short lived, implying
                   that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts.
                   The data hint at a delay of 50-100 Myr between the
                   onset of star formation and subsequent fueling of the
                   black hole. We discuss whether this may be a
                   consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could
                   play in fueling the black hole. While a significant
                   mass is ejected by OB winds and supernovae, their
                   high velocity means that very little of it can be
                   accreted. On the other hand, winds from AGB stars
                   ultimately dominate the total mass loss, and they can
                   also be accreted very efficiently because of their
                   slow speeds. Based on observations at the European

                   stars at a rate 10-100 times below commonly-used star

  year =          {2018},
  abstract =      {We develop a dynamical theory for the origin of
                   nuclear rings in barred galaxies. In analogy with the
                   standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is
                   based on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of
                   gas. However, the fact that gas follows non circular
                   orbits in an external barred potential has profound
                   consequences: instead of driving all the gas to the
                   centre, viscosity creates a trapping region where it
                   is energetically favourable to form a stable ring
                   which does not spread despite dissipation. Our theory
                   allows us to approximately predict the size of the
                   ring given the underlying gravitational potential.
                   The size of the ring is loosely related to the
                   location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance, but the
                   predicted location is more accurate and is also valid
                   for strongly barred potentials. By comparing
                   analytical predictions with the results of
                   hydrodynamical simulations, we find that our theory
                   provides a viable mechanism for ring formation if the
                   effective sound speed of the gas is low (cs<1km/s),
                   but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure
                   destroy the ring when the sound speed is high
                   (cs<10km/s). We conclude that whether this mechanism
                   for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies
                   ultimately depends on the effective equation of state
                   of the ISM. Promising confirmation comes from
                   simulations in which the ISM is modelled using
                   state-of-the-art cooling functions coupled to live
                   chemical networks, but more tests are needed
                   regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar
                   feedback. If the mechanism is relevant in real
                   galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool to
                   constrain the gravitational potential, in particular
                   the bar pattern speed.},

                   (SMBH) and the surrounding material is of primary
                   importance in modern astrophysics. The detection of
                   the molecular 2 pc circumnuclear disk (CND)
                   immediately around the Milky Way SMBH, SgrA*,
                   provides a unique opportunity to study SMBH accretion
                   at subparsec scales. Our new wide-field CS(J = 2 - 1)
                   map toward the Galactic center (GC) reveals multiple
                   dense molecular streamers that originated from the
                   ambient clouds 20 pc further out, and that are
                   connected to the central 2 pc of the CND. These dense
                   gas streamers appear to carry gas directly toward the
                   nuclear region and might be captured by the central
                   potential. Our phase-plot analysis indicates that
                   these streamers show a signature of rotation and
                   inward radial motion with progressively higher
                   velocities as the gas approaches the CND and finally
                   ends up corotating with the CND. Our results might
                   suggest a possible mechanism of gas feeding the CND
                   from 20 pc around 2 pc in the GC. In this paper, we
                   discuss the morphology and the kinematics of these

                   nucleus, this feeding process may have implications

                   Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud
                   complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA
                   1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other
                   surveys obtained over the past two decades with that
                   instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in
                   Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the
                   entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000
                   spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the
                   entire Galactic plane over a strip 4deg-10deg wide in
                   latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all
                   large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with
                   the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al.
                   (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up
                   to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10
                   times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each
                   of the component surveys was integrated individually
                   using clipping or moment masking to produce composite
                   spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy
                   that display nearly all of the statistically
                   significant emission in each survey but little noise.
                   The composite maps provide detailed information on
                   individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships
                   between clouds and regions widely separated on the
                   sky, and clearly display the main structural features
                   of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas,
                   dust, and Population I objects associated with
                   molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission
                   in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic
                   information provided by the present survey will form
                   the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies.
                   A map of molecular column density predicted from
                   complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys
                   of the Galaxy was used both to determine the
                   completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate
                   it to the entire sky at |b|<32deg. The close
                   agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies
                   that only ~2% of the total CO emission at |b|<32deg
                   lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the
                   regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into
                   account this small amount of unobserved emission, the
                   mean molecular column density decreases from ~3×1020
                   cm-2 at |b|=5deg to ~0.1×1020 cm-2 at |b|=30deg this
                   drop is ~6 times steeper than would be expected from
                   a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent
                   measurements of the mean molecular column density at
                   higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted
                   molecular column density map to the observed CO
                   intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2
                   mass conversion factor X≡NH2/WCO. Out of the
                   Galactic plane (|b|>5deg), X shows little systematic
                   variation with latitude from a mean value of
                   (1.8+/-0.3)×1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large
                   sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we
                   conclude that this is the most reliable measurement
                   to date of the mean X value in the solar
                   neighborhood.},

                   bubbles, extending 50$\,^{\circ}$ above and below the
                   Galactic center (GC), with a width of about
                   40$\,^{\circ}$ in longitude. The gamma-ray emission
                   associated with these bubbles has a significantly
                   harder spectrum (dN/dE ~ E -2) than the inverse
                   Compton emission from electrons in the Galactic disk,
                   or the gamma rays produced by the decay of pions from
                   proton-interstellar medium collisions. There is no
                   significant spatial variation in the spectrum or
                   gamma-ray intensity within the bubbles, or between
                   the north and south bubbles. The bubbles are
                   spatially correlated with the hard-spectrum microwave
                   excess known as the WMAP haze; the edges of the
                   bubbles also line up with features in the ROSAT X-ray
                   maps at 1.5-2 keV. We argue that these Galactic
                   gamma-ray bubbles were most likely created by some
                   large episode of energy injection in the GC, such as
                   past accretion events onto the central massive black
                   hole, or a nuclear starburst in the last ~10 Myr.
                   Dark matter annihilation/decay seems unlikely to
                   generate all the features of the bubbles and the
                   associated signals in WMAP and ROSAT; the bubbles
                   must be understood in order to use measurements of
                   the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner Galaxy as
                   a probe of dark matter physics. Study of the origin
                   and evolution of the bubbles also has the potential
                   to improve our understanding of recent energetic
                   events in the inner Galaxy and the high-latitude
                   cosmic ray population.},

                   seen in radio continuum images of the GC region. If
                   it is actually located in the GC region, formation
                   models would require massive energy input (e.g.,
                   starburst or jet) to create it. At present,
                   observations have not strongly constrained the
                   location or physical conditions of the GC lobe. This
                   paper describes the analysis of new and archival
                   single-dish observations of radio recombination lines
                   toward this enigmatic object. The observations find
                   that the ionized gas has a morphology similar to the
                   radio continuum emission, suggesting that they are
                   associated. We study averages of several transitions
                   from H106alpha to H191epsilon and find that the line
                   ratios are most consistent with gas in local
                   thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination
                   line widths are remarkably narrow, constraining the
                   typical electron temperature to be less than about
                   4000 K. These observations also find evidence of
                   pressure broadening in the higher electronic states,
                   implying a gas density of ne = 910+310 -450 cm-3. The
                   electron temperature, gas pressure, and morphology
                   are all consistent with the idea that the GC lobe is
                   located in the GC region. If so, the ionized gas
                   appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100
                   parsecs of the galaxy with a mass of roughly 105 M
                   sun, similar to ionized outflows seen in dwarf
                   starbursts.},

                   of gas that spans the central degree of our Galaxy.
                   It has been cited as evidence for a mass outflow from
                   our GC region, which has inspired diverse models for
                   its origin. However, most work has focused on the
                   morphology of the GC lobe, which has made it
                   difficult to draw strong conclusions about its
                   nature. Here, I present a coherent, multiwavelength
                   analysis of new and archival observations of the GC
                   lobe. New radio continuum observations show that the
                   entire structure has a similar spectral index,
                   indicating that it has a common origin. The radio
                   continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a
                   magnetized layer with a diameter of 110 pc and an
                   equipartition field strength ranging from 40 to 100
                   muG. I show that optical and radio recombination line
                   emission are associated with the GC lobe and are
                   consistent with being located in the GC region. The
                   recombination line emission traces an ionized shell
                   nested within the radio continuum with diameter of 80
                   pc and height 165 pc. Mid-infrared maps at 8 and 15
                   mum show that the GC lobe has a third layer of warm
                   dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-emission
                   that surrounds the radio continuum shell with a
                   diameter of 130 pc. Assuming adiabatic expansion of
                   the gas in the GC lobe, its formation required an
                   energy input of about 5 × 1052 ergs. I compare the
                   physical conditions of the GC lobe to several models
                   and find best agreement with the canonical starburst
                   outflow model. The formation of the GC lobe is
                   consistent with the currently observed pressure and
                   star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of
                   our Galaxy. Outflows of this scale are more typical
                   of dwarf galaxies and would not be easily detected in
                   nearby spiral galaxies. Thus, the existence of such
                   an outflow in our own Galaxy may indicate that it is
                   a relatively common phenomenon in the nuclei of
                   spiral galaxies.},

                   a complex of molecular clouds that exhibits
                   fluorescent line emission, four that are superimposed

                   basis of the star formation rate at the Galactic
                   center, we expect that ~20 pulsars have formed in the
                   last 300 kyr and could be producing pulsar wind
                   nebulae. Only 1 of the 19 candidate pulsar wind
                   nebulae is securely detected in an archival radio
                   image of the Galactic center; the remainder have
                   upper limits corresponding to LRlesssim 1031 erg s-1.
                   These radio limits do not strongly constrain their
                   natures, which underscores the need for further
                   multiwavelength studies of this unprecedented sample
                   of Galactic X-ray-emitting structures.},

                   September 1999 to July 2017. This unprecedented
                   dataset enables us to examine flux and spectral
                   variations that might be related to intrinsic
                   properties of the weakly accreting SMBH. We find no

                   the G2 periapsis passage around early 2014, however,
                   a marginal flux increase might be associated with the
                   periapsis passage of G1 in early 2001. The filament
                   exhibits an unusually hard spectrum (photon-index
                   $\lesssim$1) in its near-side (with respect to Sgr
                   A*) and a significant spectral softening in the
                   far-side, which can be interpreted as synchrotron
                   cooling of the relativistic electrons in the jet. In
                   particular, the hard spectrum of the near-side
                   suggests a piling up of quasi-monoenergetic electrons
                   caused by rapid radiative cooling. Therefore, we
                   conclude that G359.944-0.052 remains a viable

  abstract =      {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential
                   of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky
                   Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics,
                   potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence
                   of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
                   orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the
                   CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in
                   the empirically constrained gravitational potential
                   and represents a good fit (chi _red^2=2.0) to the
                   observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n >
                   several 103 cm-3) gas, reproducing all of its key
                   properties. The orbit is also consistent with
                   observational constraints not included in the fitting
                   process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2
                   and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs
                   from previous, parametric models in several respects:
                   (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the
                   extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its
                   orbital velocity (100-200 km s-1) is twice as high as
                   in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the
                   focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
                   offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently
                   proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between
                   G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an
                   absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of
                   which the condensation was triggered by the tidal
                   compression during their most recent pericentre
                   passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
                   and find that their pericentre passages occurred
                   0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times
                   (tff ˜ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016
                   and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are
                   separated by a single free-fall time of evolution,
                   implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once
                   collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete
                   orbital solution, as well as several quantitative
                   predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the
                   positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is
                   concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and
                   possible caveats, as well as the position of the
                   model in the Galactic context, highlighting its
                   relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics
                   of the bar, the x2 orbital family, and the origin of
                   the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.},

                   is thought to differ from that in galactic discs due
                   to a significant influence of the external
                   gravitational potential. We present a set of
                   numerical simulations of molecular clouds orbiting on
                   the 100-pc stream of the Central Molecular Zone (the
                   central $\sim500$ pc of the Galaxy) and characterise
                   their morphological and kinematic evolution in
                   response to the background potential and eccentric
                   orbital motion. We find that the clouds are shaped by
                   strong shear and torques, by tidal and geometric
                   deformation, and by their passage through the orbital
                   pericentre. Within our simulations, these mechanisms
                   control cloud sizes, aspect ratios, position angles,
                   filamentary structure, column densities, velocity
                   dispersions, line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin
                   angular momenta, and kinematic complexity. By
                   comparing these predictions to observations of clouds
                   on the Galactic Centre 'dust ridge', we find that our
                   simulations naturally reproduce a broad range of key
                   observed morphological and kinematic features, which
                   can be explained in terms of well-understood physical
                   mechanisms. We argue that the accretion of gas clouds
                   onto the central regions of galaxies, where the
                   rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is
                   fully compressive, is accompanied by transformative
                   dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to collapse
                   and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary
                   progression of cloud collapse with a common starting
                   point, which either marks the time of accretion onto
                   the tidally-compressive region or of the most recent
                   pericentre passage. Together, these processes may
                   naturally produce the synchronised starbursts
                   observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.},

                   sub-regions, including Sgr C, the 20 and 50 km s-1
                   clouds, the dust ridge, and Sgr B2. Shell-like
                   emission features can be explained by the projection
                   of independent molecular clouds in Sgr C and the
                   newly identified conical profile of Sgr B2 in {l, b,
                   vLSR} space. These features have previously invoked
                   supernova-driven shells and cloud-cloud collisions as
                   explanations. We instead caution against structure
                   identification in velocity-integrated emission maps.
                   Three geometries describing the 3D structure of the
                   CMZ are investigated: (i) two spiral arms; (ii) a
                   closed elliptical orbit; (iii) an open stream. While
                   two spiral arms and an open stream qualitatively
                   reproduce the gas distribution, the most recent
                   parametrization of the closed elliptical orbit does
                   not. Finally, we discuss how proper motion
                   measurements of masers can distinguish between these
                   geometries, and suggest that this effort should be
                   focused on the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds and Sgr

                   connected in position--velocity space via a third
                   southern component around 50 km s-1. Further
                   position--velocity analysis of the surrounding
                   region, using lower-resolution survey observations
                   taken with the Mopra and ATCA telescopes, indicates
                   that both molecular components in M0.20-0.033 are
                   physically connected to the M0.10-0.08 molecular
                   cloud, which is suggested to be located on stream 1

                   indicate that the two velocity components in
                   M0.20-0.033 constitute an expanding shell. Our
                   observations suggest that the M0.20-0.033 expanding
                   shell has an expansion velocity of 40 km s-1, with a
                   systemic velocity of 53 km s-1, comparable to
                   velocities detected in M0.10-0.08. The origin of the
                   expanding shell is located near the Quintuplet
                   cluster, suggesting that the energy and momentum
                   output from this massive stellar cluster may have
                   contributed to the expansion.},

                   supermassive black hole, and large-scale outflows.
                   This inflow happens mostly through two symmetrical
                   dust lanes, similar to those often seen in external
                   barred galaxies. Here, we use the fact that the Milky
                   Way dust lanes have been previously identified in
                   12CO datacubes and a simple geometrical model to
                   derive the first observational determination of the
                   mass inflow rate into the Central Molecular Zone. We
                   find that the time-averaged inflow rate along the

                   1.5^{+0.9}_{-1.0} M_&sun; yr^{-1}, which gives a

                   also provide the time series of the inflow rate
                   \dot{M} for the future few Myr. The latter shows that

                   statistical tools developed from methods proposed in
                   the literature. We test whether our methods are
                   sensitive to changes in the underlying physical
                   properties of the clouds or whether their behaviour
                   is governed by random fluctuations. We perform a set
                   of 32 self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic
                   simulations that test all combinations of five
                   physical parameters - Mach number, plasma parameter,
                   virial parameter, driving scales and solenoidal
                   driving fraction - each of which can be set to a low
                   or high value. We create mock observational data sets
                   of 13CO(1-0) emission from each simulation. We
                   compare these mock data to those generated from a set
                   of baseline simulations using pseudo-distance metrics
                   based on 18 different statistical techniques that
                   have previously been used to study molecular clouds.
                   We analyse these results using methods from the
                   statistical field of experimental design and find
                   that several of the statistics can reliably track
                   changes in the underlying physics. Our analysis shows
                   that the interactions between parameters are often
                   among the most significant effects. A small fraction
                   of statistics are also sensitive to changes in
                   magnetic field properties. We use this framework to
                   compare the set of simulations to observations of
                   three nearby star-forming regions: NGC 1333, Oph A
                   and IC 348. We find that no one simulation agrees
                   significantly better with the observations, although
                   there is evidence that the high Mach number
                   simulations are more consistent with the

                   that are self-gravitating. We present an analytic
                   determination of the star formation rate (SFR) in a
                   gravoturbulent medium based on the density
                   probability distribution function of molecular clouds
                   having a piecewise lognormal (LN) and power-law (PL)
                   form. This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR
                   models that are governed primarily by interstellar
                   turbulence, which sets purely LN density probability
                   distribution functions (PDFs). In the gravoturbulent
                   SFR model described herein, low-density gas resides
                   in the LN portion of the PDF. Gas becomes
                   gravitationally unstable past a critical density (rho
                   crit), and the PDF begins to form a PL. As the
                   collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional
                   density (rho t ) between the LN and PL portions of
                   the PDF moves toward lower density while the slope of
                   the PL (alpha) becomes increasingly shallow. The SFR
                   per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over
                   the LN from rho crit to rho t and an integral over
                   the PL from rho t to the maximum density. As alpha
                   becomes shallower, the SFR accelerates beyond the
                   expected values calculated from an LN density PDF. We
                   show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall
                   time in observations of local molecular clouds
                   increases with shallower PDF PL slopes, in agreement
                   with our model. Our model can explain why star
                   formation is spatially and temporally variable within
                   a cloud and why the depletion times observed in local
                   and extragalactic giant molecular clouds vary. Both
                   star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems can
                   be explained without the need to invoke extreme
                   variations of turbulence in the local interstellar
                   environment.},

  abstract =      {There is now abundant evidence that the luminosity of
                   the Galactic super-massive black hole (SMBH) has not
                   always been as low as it is nowadays. The observation
                   of varying non-thermal diffuse X-ray emission in
                   molecular complexes in the central 300 pc has been
                   interpreted as delayed reflection of a past
                   illumination by bright outbursts of the SMBH. The
                   observation of different variability timescales of
                   the reflected emission in the Sgr A molecular complex
                   can be well explained if the X-ray emission of at
                   least two distinct and relatively short events (i.e.
                   about 10 yr or less) is currently propagating through
                   the region. The number of such events or the presence
                   of a long-duration illumination are open questions.
                   Variability of the reflected emission all over of the
                   central 300 pc, in particular in the 6.4 keV Fe
                   Kalpha line, can bring strong constraints. To do so
                   we performed a deep scan of the inner 300 pc with
                   XMM-Newton in 2012. Together with all the archive
                   data taken over the course of the mission, and in
                   particular a similar albeit more shallow scan
                   performed in 2000-2001, this allows for a detailed
                   study of variability of the 6.4 keV line emission in
                   the region, which we present here. We show that the
                   overall 6.4 keV emission does not strongly vary on
                   average, but variations are very pronounced on
                   smaller scales. In particular, most regions showing
                   bright reflection emission in 2000-2001 significantly
                   decrease by 2012. We discuss those regions and
                   present newly illuminated features. The absence of
                   bright steady emission argues against the presence of
                   an echo from an event of multi-centennial duration
                   and most, if not all, of the emission can likely be
                   explained by a limited number of relatively short
                   (i.e. up to 10 yr) events. Images of the Fe Kalpha

  abstract =      {We present a three-dimensional map of interstellar
                   dust reddening, covering three-quarters of the sky
                   out to a distance of several kiloparsecs, based on
                   Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and 2MASS photometry. The map
                   reveals a wealth of detailed structure, from
                   filaments to large cloud complexes. The map has a
                   hybrid angular resolution, with most of the map at an
                   angular resolution of 3\buildrel{ \prime}\over{.}
                   4-13\buildrel{ \prime}\over{.} 7, and a maximum
                   distance resolution of ˜ 25%. The three-dimensional
                   distribution of dust is determined in a fully
                   probabilistic framework, yielding the uncertainty in
                   the reddening distribution along each line of sight,
                   as well as stellar distances, reddenings, and
                   classifications for 800 million stars detected by
                   PS1. We demonstrate the consistency of our reddening
                   estimates with those of two-dimensional
                   emission-based maps of dust reddening. In particular,
                   we find agreement with the Planck {tau
                   }353{GHz}-based reddening map to within 0.05 {mag} in
                   E(B-V) to a depth of 0.5 {mag}, and explore
                   systematics at reddenings less than E(B-V)≈ 0.08
                   {mag}. We validate our per-star reddening estimates
                   by comparison with reddening estimates for stars with
                   both Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry and Sloan
                   Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration
                   spectral classifications, finding per-star agreement
                   to within 0.1 {mag} out to a stellar E(B-V) of 1 mag.
                   We compare our map to two existing three-dimensional
                   dust maps, by Marshall et al. and Lallement et al.,
                   demonstrating our finer angular resolution, and
                   better distance resolution compared to the former
                   within ˜ 3 {kpc}. The map can be queried or
                   downloaded at http://argonaut.skymaps.info. We expect
                   the three-dimensional reddening map presented here to
                   find a wide range of uses, among them correcting for
                   reddening and extinction for objects embedded in the
                   plane of the Galaxy, studies of Galactic structure,
                   calibration of future emission-based dust maps, and
                   determining distances to objects of known reddening.},

                   that on the ˜10 pc size scale of individual cloud
                   cores, HCN 1-0 is well correlated with dense gas mass
                   when plotted as a log-log relationship. There is
                   ˜0.75 dex of scatter in this relationship from
                   clouds like Sgr B2, which has an integrated HCN 1-0
                   intensity of a cloud less than half its mass, and
                   others that have HCN 1-0 enhanced by a factor of 2-3
                   relative to clouds of comparable mass. We identify
                   the two primary sources of scatter to be
                   self-absorption and variations in HCN abundance. We
                   also find that the extended HCN 1-0 emission is more
                   intense per unit mass than in individual cloud cores.
                   In fact the majority (80%) of HCN 1-0 emission comes
                   from extended gas with column densities below 7 ×
                   1022 cm-2, accounting for 68% of the total mass. We
                   find variations in the brightness of HCN 1-0 would
                   only yield a ˜10% error in the dense gas mass
                   inferred from this line in the Galactic center.
                   However, the observed order of magnitude HCN
                   abundance variations, and the systematic nature of
                   these variations, warn of potential biases in the use
                   of HCN as dense gas mass tracer in more extreme
                   environments such as an active galactic nucleus and
                   shock-dominated regions. We also investigate other 3
                   mm tracers, finding that HNCO is better correlated
                   with mass than HCN, and might be a better tracer of
                   cloud mass in this environment.},

                   stellar initial mass function (IMF) in the extreme
                   Galactic center environment. We use multi-epoch
                   Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain
                   high-precision proper-motion and photometric
                   measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster
                   membership probabilities for stars down to ~1.8 M
                   &sun; between cluster radii of 0.25 and 3.0 pc. We
                   achieve a cluster sample with just ~6% field
                   contamination, a significant improvement over
                   photometrically selected samples that are severely
                   compromised by the differential extinction across the
                   field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy
                   of five cluster members, we forward model the Arches
                   cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other
                   properties (such as age and total mass) while
                   accounting for observational uncertainties,
                   completeness, mass segregation, and stellar
                   multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best
                   described by a one-segment power law that is
                   significantly top-heavy: alpha = 1.80 $\pm$ 0.05
                   (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys), where dN/dm ∝ m -alpha ,
                   though we cannot discount a two-segment power-law
                   model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower
                   than local star-forming regions (alpha
                   ={2.04}-0.19+0.14+/- 0.04) but with a break at
                   {5.8}-1.2+3.2+/- 0.02 {M}o . In either case, the
                   Arches IMF is significantly different than the
                   standard IMF. Comparing the Arches to other young
                   massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative
                   evidence for a systematically top-heavy IMF at the

                   process in astrophysics and cosmology. Stars are
                   known to form from the gravitational collapse of
                   dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it
                   has been proposed that the resulting star formation
                   rate is proportional to either the amount of mass
                   above a threshold gas surface density, or the gas
                   volume density. These star formation prescriptions
                   appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our
                   Milky Way Galaxy's disc as well as in distant
                   galaxies where the star formation rates are often
                   much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the
                   Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest
                   concentration of dense, high-surface density
                   molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an
                   environment where the validity of star formation
                   prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show that by
                   several measures, the current star formation rate in
                   the CMZ is an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates
                   predicted by the currently accepted prescriptions. In
                   particular, the region 1$\,^{\circ}$ < l <
                   3$\,^{\circ}$.5, |b| < 0$\,^{\circ}$.5 contains ˜107
                   M&sun; of dense (> several 103 cm-3) molecular gas -
                   enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the
                   present-day star formation rate within this gas is
                   only equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to
                   density, another property of molecular clouds must be
                   included in the star formation prescription to
                   predict the star formation rate in a given mass of
                   molecular gas. We discuss which physical mechanisms
                   might be responsible for suppressing star formation

                   the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown
                   whether or not these theories extend to clouds in
                   high-pressure (P/k > 107 K cm--3) environments, like
                   those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular
                   zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we
                   present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
                   3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud,
                   G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure
                   environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape
                   and dispersion of its column density probability
                   distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to
                   those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one
                   important quantitative difference: its mean column
                   density is one to two orders of magnitude higher.
                   Both the similarity and difference in the PDF
                   compared to those derived from solar neighborhood
                   clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models
                   given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The
                   PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high
                   column densities confirming the youth of
                   G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is
                   consistent with the theoretically predicted,
                   environmentally dependent volume density threshold
                   for star formation which is orders of magnitude
                   higher than that derived for solar neighborhood
                   clouds. Our results provide the first empirical
                   evidence that the current theoretical understanding
                   of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar
                   neighborhood also holds in high-pressure
                   environments. We therefore suggest that these
                   theories may be applicable to understand star
                   formation in the early universe.},

                   calibrated in the disc of our own and nearby
                   galaxies. Understanding how and why star formation

                   we are to understand the environmental dependence of

                   detection of a sample of high-mass cores in the CMZ's
                   `dust ridge' that have been discovered with the
                   Submillimeter Array. These cores range in mass from
                   ˜50-2150 M&sun; within radii of 0.1-0.25 pc. All
                   appear to be young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are
                   prime candidates for representing the initial
                   conditions of high-mass stars and sub-clusters. We
                   report that at least two of these cores (`c1' and
                   `e1') contain young, high-mass protostars. We compare
                   all of the detected cores with high-mass cores and
                   clouds in the Galactic disc and find that they are
                   broadly similar in terms of their masses and sizes,
                   despite being subjected to external pressures that
                   are several orders of magnitude greater, ˜108 K

                   per cent of these cores do not show any signs of
                   star-forming activity in such a high-pressure
                   environment leads us to conclude that this is further
                   evidence for an increased critical density threshold

                   than the disc; akin to the environment found in
                   star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Previous
                   studies have shown that this region is forming stars
                   at a rate per unit mass of dense gas which is at
                   least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc,
                   potentially violating theoretical predictions. We
                   show that all observational star formation rate
                   diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar
                   objects and integrated light measurements - are in
                   agreement within a factor two, hence the low star
                   formation rate (SFR) is not the result of the
                   systematic uncertainties that affect any one method.
                   As these methods trace the star formation over
                   different time-scales, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, we conclude
                   that the SFR has been constant to within a factor of
                   a few within this time period. We investigate the
                   progression of star formation within gravitationally
                   bound clouds on ~parsec scales and find 1-4 per cent
                   of the cloud masses are converted into stars per
                   free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the
                   considered 'volumetric' star formation models.
                   However, discriminating between these models is
                   obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input
                   observables and, most importantly and urgently, by
                   their dependence on ill-constrained free parameters.
                   The lack of empirical constraints on these parameters
                   therefore represents a key challenge in the further
                   verification or falsification of current star
                   formation theories.},

                   at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources,
                   most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out
                   alternative possibilities, we conclude that these
                   sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions
                   and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly
                   detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that,
                   based on their luminosities, must contain objects
                   with stellar masses {M}* ≳ 8 {M}o . Their spatial
                   distribution spread over a ~12 × 3 pc region
                   demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended
                   star formation event, not just an isolated
                   ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using
                   this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds
                   and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of
                   the YSOs reside in regions of high column density
                   (N({{{H}}}2)≳ 2× {10}23 {{cm}}-2), not all regions
                   of high column density contain YSOs. The observed
                   column density threshold for star formation is
                   substantially higher than that in solar vicinity
                   clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation
                   requires a higher column density or that any star
                   formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in
                   nearby clouds. The relation between the surface
                   density of gas and stars is incompatible with
                   extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar
                   densities in Sgr B2 follow a linear {{{Sigma }}}*
                   {--}{{{Sigma }}}{gas} relation, shallower than that
                   observed in local clouds. Together, these points
                   suggest that a higher volume density threshold is
                   required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.},

                   rates in the Milky Way can be estimated directly from
                   young stellar objects (YSOs). In the central
                   molecular zone the star formation rate calculated
                   from the number of YSOs with 24 mum emission is up to
                   an order of magnitude higher than the value estimated
                   from methods based on diffuse emission (such as
                   free-free emission). Whether this effect is real or
                   whether it indicates problems with either or both
                   star formation rate measures is not currently known.
                   In this paper, we investigate whether estimates based
                   on YSOs could be heavily contaminated by more evolved
                   objects such as main-sequence stars. We present
                   radiative transfer models of YSOs and of
                   main-sequence stars in a constant ambient medium
                   which show that the main-sequence objects can indeed
                   mimic YSOs at 24 mum. However, we show that in some
                   cases the main-sequence models can be marginally
                   resolved at 24 mum, whereas the YSO models are always
                   unresolved. Based on the fraction of resolved MIPS 24
                   mum sources in the sample of YSOs previously used to
                   compute the star formation rate, we estimate the
                   fraction of misclassified "YSOs" to be at least 63%,
                   which suggests that the star formation rate
                   previously determined from YSOs is likely to be at
                   least a factor of three too high.},

                   Zone (CMZ). Using interferometer observations of H2O
                   masers and ultra-compact H II regions, we find
                   evidence of ongoing star formation embedded in cores
                   of 0.2 pc scales and ≳105 cm-3 densities. Among the
                   five clouds, Sgr C possesses a high (9%) fraction of
                   gas mass in gravitationally bound and/or protostellar
                   cores, and follows the dense (≳104 cm-3) gas star
                   formation relation that is extrapolated from nearby
                   clouds. The other four clouds have less than 1% of

                   inactive star formation in these CMZ clouds could be
                   because there is much less gas confined in
                   gravitationally bound cores, which may be a result of
                   the strong turbulence in this region and/or the very
                   early evolutionary stage of the clouds when collapse

                   Submillimeter Array (SMA). We identify the locations
                   of dense cores and search for signatures of embedded
                   star formation. CMZoom is a three-year survey in its
                   final year and is mapping out the highest column
                   density regions of the CMZ in dust continuum and a
                   variety of spectral lines around 1.3 mm. CMZoom
                   combines SMA compact and subcompact configurations
                   with single-dish data from BGPS and the APEX
                   telescope, achieving an angular resolution of about
                   4'' (0.2 pc) and good image fidelity up to large
                   spatial scales.},

  abstract =      {NGC 253 hosts the nearest nuclear starburst. Previous
                   observations show a region rich in molecular gas,
                   with dense clouds associated with recent star
                   formation. We used the Atacama Large
                   Submillimeter/Millimeter Array (ALMA) to image the
                   350 GHz dust continuum and molecular line emission
                   from this region at 2 pc resolution. Our observations
                   reveal ~14 bright, compact (~2--3 pc FWHM) knots of
                   dust emission. Most of these sources are likely to be
                   forming super star clusters (SSCs) based on their
                   inferred dynamical and gas masses, association with
                   36 GHz radio continuum emission, and coincidence with
                   line emission tracing dense, excited gas. One source
                   coincides with a known SSC, but the rest remain
                   invisible in Hubble near-infrared (IR) imaging. Our
                   observations imply that gas still constitutes a large
                   fraction of the overall mass in these sources. Their
                   high brightness temperature at 350 GHz also implies a
                   large optical depth near the peak of the IR spectral
                   energy distribution. As a result, these sources may
                   have large IR photospheres, and the IR radiation
                   force likely exceeds L/c. Still, their moderate
                   observed velocity dispersions suggest that feedback
                   from radiation, winds, and supernovae are not yet
                   disrupting most sources. This mode of star formation
                   appears to produce a large fraction of stars in the
                   burst. We argue for a scenario in which this phase
                   lasts ~1 Myr, after which the clusters shed their
                   natal cocoons but continue to produce ionizing
                   photons. The strong feedback that drives the observed
                   cold gas and X-ray outflows likely occurs after the
                   clusters emerge from this early phase.},
