                   from the HERACLES survey, with tracers of the recent
                   star formation rate (SFR) across 30 nearby disk
                   galaxies. We demonstrate a first-order linear
                   correspondence between Sigmamol and SigmaSFR but also
                   find important second-order systematic variations in
                   the apparent molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol = \Sigma _mol / \Sigma _SFR. At the 1 kpc
                   common resolution of HERACLES, CO emission correlates
                   closely with many tracers of the recent SFR.
                   Weighting each line of sight equally, using a fixed
                   alphaCO equivalent to the Milky Way value, our data
                   yield a molecular gas depletion time, \tau
                   _dep^mol=\Sigma _mol/\Sigma _SFR \approx 2.2 Gyr with
                   0.3 dex 1sigma scatter, in very good agreement with
                   recent literature data. We apply a forward-modeling
                   approach to constrain the power-law index, N, that
                   relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas
                   surface density, \Sigma _SFR \propto \Sigma _mol^N.
                   We find N = 1 $\pm$ 0.15 for our full data set with
                   some scatter from galaxy to galaxy. This also agrees
                   with recent work, but we caution that a power-law
                   treatment oversimplifies the topic given that we
                   observe correlations between \tau _dep^mol and other
                   local and global quantities. The strongest of these
                   are a decreased \tau _dep^mol in low-mass,
                   low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the
                   kpc-scale \tau _dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G.
                   These correlations can be explained by a CO-to-H2
                   conversion factor (alphaCO) that depends on dust
                   shielding, and thus D/G, in the theoretically
                   expected way. This is not a unique interpretation,
                   but external evidence of conversion factor variations
                   makes this the most conservative explanation of the
                   strongest observed \tau _dep^mol trends. After
                   applying a D/G-dependent alphaCO, some weak
                   correlations between \tau _dep^mol and local
                   conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower
                   \tau _dep^mol and enhanced CO excitation associated
                   with nuclear gas concentrations in a subset of our
                   targets. These appear to reflect real enhancements in
                   the rate of star formation per unit gas, and although
                   the distribution of taudep does not appear bimodal in
                   galaxy centers, taudep does appear multivalued at
                   fixed SigmaH2, supporting the idea of "disk" and
                   "starburst" modes driven by other environmental
                   parameters.},

                   resolution of the grid. For all sound speeds and
                   resolutions, streamlines closely follow closed orbits
                   at large and small radii. At intermediate radii
                   shocks arise and the streamlines shift between two

  abstract =      {We examine the stability of feedback-regulated star
                   formation (SF) in galactic nuclei and contrast it to
                   SF in extended discs. In galactic nuclei the
                   dynamical time becomes shorter than the time over
                   which feedback from young stars evolves. We argue
                   analytically that the balance between stellar
                   feedback and gravity is unstable in this regime. We
                   study this using numerical simulations with pc-scale
                   resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from
                   stellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young
                   stellar mass, and SFR within the central ~100 pc (the
                   short-timescale regime) never reach steady-state, but
                   instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles.
                   Stars form until a critical surface density of young
                   stars is present (such that feedback overwhelms
                   gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from
                   the nucleus. Since the dynamical times are shorter
                   than the stellar evolution times, the stars do not
                   die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push,
                   triggering a runaway quenching of star formation in
                   the nucleus. However the expelled gas is largely not
                   unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic
                   fountain which re-fills the nuclear region after the
                   massive stars from the previous burst cycle have died
                   off (~50 Myr timescale). On large scales (>1 kpc),
                   the galaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable.
                   We examine the consequences of this episodic nuclear
                   star formation for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS)
                   relation: while a tight KS relation exists on ~1 kpc
                   scales in good agreement with observations, the
                   scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures

                   formation and winds in the nuclear regions of
                   galaxies, focusing on the Milky Way's Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). In our model angular momentum
                   and mass are transported by a combination of
                   gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities.
                   In gravitationally unstable regions the gas can form
                   stars, and the resulting feedback drives both
                   turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ.
                   We show that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where
                   mass deposited at large radii by the bar is
                   transported inwards to a star-forming, ring-shaped
                   region at ˜100 pc from the Galactic Centre, where
                   the shear reaches a minimum. This ring undergoes
                   episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting ˜5-10 Myr
                   occurring at ˜20-40 Myr intervals. During quiescence
                   the gas in the ring is not fully cleared, but is
                   driven out of a self-gravitating state by the
                   momentum injected by expanding supernova remnants.
                   Starbursts also drive a wind off the star-forming
                   ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to
                   the star formation rate. We show that our model
                   agrees well with the observed properties of the CMZ,
                   and places it near a star formation minimum within
                   the evolutionary cycle. We argue that such cycles of
                   bursty star formation and winds should be ubiquitous
                   in the nuclei of barred spiral galaxies, and show
                   that the resulting distribution of galactic nuclei on
                   the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation is in good agreement
                   with that observed in nearby galaxies.},

                   parsecs of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone,
                   is strongly asymmetric. Indeed, approximately three
                   quarters of molecular emission come from positive
                   longitudes, and only one quarter from negative
                   longitudes. However, despite much theoretical effort,
                   the origin of this asymmetry has remained a mystery.
                   Here, we show that the asymmetry can be neatly
                   explained by unsteady flow of gas in a barred
                   potential. We use high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical
                   simulations coupled to a state-of-the-art chemical
                   network. Despite the initial conditions and the bar
                   potential being point symmetric with respect to the
                   Galactic Centre, asymmetries develop spontaneously
                   due to the combination of a hydrodynamical
                   instability known as the `wiggle instability' and the
                   thermal instability. The observed asymmetry must be
                   transient: observations made tens of megayears in the
                   past or in the future would often show an asymmetry
                   in the opposite sense. Fluctuations of amplitude
                   comparable to the observed asymmetry occur for a
                   large fraction of time in our simulations, and
                   suggest that the present is not an exceptional moment

                   lifetime is set by the time-scales for gravitational
                   collapse, galactic shear, spiral arm interactions,
                   epicyclic perturbations and cloud-cloud collisions.
                   It is dependent on five observable quantities,
                   accessible through measurements of the galactic
                   rotation curve, the gas and stellar surface
                   densities, and the gas and stellar velocity
                   dispersions of the host galaxy. We determine how the
                   relative importance of each dynamical mechanism
                   varies throughout the space of observable galactic
                   properties, and conclude that gravitational collapse
                   and galactic shear play the greatest role in setting
                   the cloud lifetime for the considered range of galaxy
                   properties, while cloud-cloud collisions exert a much
                   lesser influence. All five environmental mechanisms
                   are nevertheless required to obtain a complete
                   picture of cloud evolution. We apply our theory to
                   the galaxies M31, M51, M83, and the Milky Way, and
                   find a strong dependence of the cloud lifetime upon
                   galactocentric radius in each case, with a typical
                   cloud lifetime between 10 and 50 Myr. Our theory is
                   ideally-suited for systematic observational tests

                   array.},

                   This inflow happens mostly through two symmetrical
                   dust-lanes, similar to those often seen in external
                   barred galaxies. Here we use the fact that the Milky

                   $^{12}$CO datacubes and a simple geometrical model to
                   derive the first observational determination of the
                   mass inflow rate into the Central Molecular Zone. We
                   find that the time-averaged inflow rate along the

                   $1.5^{+0.9}_{-1.0}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which
                   gives a total inflow of $2.7^{+1.5}_{-1.7}\, \rm

                   the inflow rate $\dot{M}$ for the future few Myr. The
                   latter shows that the inflow rate is variable with
                   time, supporting a scenario of episodic accretion

                   the framework to perform an analysis of various
                   statistical tools developed from methods proposed in
                   the literature. We test whether our methods are
                   sensitive to changes in the underlying physical
                   properties of the clouds or whether their behaviour
                   is governed by random fluctuations. We perform a set
                   of 32 self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic
                   simulations that test all combinations of five
                   physical parameters -- Mach number, plasma parameter,
                   virial parameter, driving scales, and solenoidal
                   driving fraction -- each of which can be set to a low

                   of ${\rm ^{13}CO}$(1-0) emission from each
                   simulation. We compare these mock data to a those
                   generated from a set of baseline simulations using
                   pseudo-distance metrics based on 18 different
                   statistical techniques that have previously been used
                   to study molecular clouds. We analyze these results
                   using methods from the statistical field of
                   experimental design and find that several of the
                   statistics can reliably track changes in the
                   underlying physics. Our analysis shows that the
                   interactions between parameters are often among the
                   most significant effects. A small fraction of
                   statistics are also sensitive to changes in magnetic
                   field properties. We use this framework to compare
                   the set of simulations to observations of three
                   nearby star-forming regions: NGC 1333, Oph A, and IC
                   348. We find that no one simulation agrees
                   significantly better with the observations, although
                   there is evidence that the high Mach number
                   simulations are more consistent with the

                   probability distribution function (PDF) of density in
                   giant molecular clouds. This is in contrast to
                   previous analytic SFR models that use purely
                   lognormal density PDFs. Low density gas resides in
                   the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes
                   gravitationally unstable past a critical density
                   ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a power
                   law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the
                   transitional density ($\rho_t$) between the lognormal
                   and power law portions of the PDF moves towards
                   lower-density while the slope of the power law
                   ($\alpha$) becomes increasingly shallow. The star
                   formation rate per free-fall time is calculated via
                   an integral over the lognormal from $\rho_{crit}$ to
                   $\rho_t$ and an integral over the power law from
                   $\rho_t$ to infinity. As $\alpha$ becomes shallower
                   the SFR increases beyond the expected values
                   calculated from a lognormal density PDF. We show that
                   the star formation efficiency per free fall time in
                   local molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF
                   power law slopes, in agreement with our model. The
                   approach presented here yields star formation rates
                   in good agreement with both local GMCs and
                   extragalactic observations. Our model can explain why
                   star formation is spatially and temporally variable
                   within a cloud and can accelerate and why the
                   depletion times observed in local and extragalactic
                   giant molecular clouds vary. Our model can explain
                   both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems
                   without the need to invoke extreme variations in the

                   temperatures of the dense gas in the central

                   the Galactic plane with a linear resolution of 1.2pc.
                   The strongest of the three lines, the H2CO (303 -->
                   202) transition, is found to be widespread, and its
                   emission shows a spatial distribution similar to
                   ammonia. The relative abundance of para-H2CO is 0.5 -
                   1.2 × 10-9, which is consistent with results from
                   lower frequency H2CO absorption lines. Derived gas
                   kinetic temperatures for individual molecular clouds
                   range from 50K to values in excess of 100K. While a
                   systematic trend toward (decreasing) kinetic
                   temperature versus (increasing) angular distance from
                   the Galactic center (GC) is not found, the clouds
                   with highest temperature (Tkin > 100K) are all
                   located near the nucleus. For the molecular gas
                   outside the dense clouds, the average kinetic
                   temperature is 65 $\pm$ 10K. The high temperatures of
                   molecular clouds on large scales in the GC region may
                   be driven by turbulent energy dissipation and/or
                   cosmic-rays instead of photons. Such a

                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   significantly hotter than the dust temperatures
                   throughout the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of
                   the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in the context of
                   the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. that interprets
                   the observed distribution as a stream of molecular
                   clouds following an open eccentric orbit. This allows
                   us to statistically investigate the time dependencies
                   of gas temperature, column density, and line width.
                   We find heating rates between ˜50 and ˜100 K Myr-1
                   along the stream orbit. No strong signs of time
                   dependence are found for column density or line
                   width. These quantities are likely dominated by
                   cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results qualitatively
                   match the predictions of the current model of tidal
                   triggering of cloud collapse, orbital kinematics, and
                   the observation of an evolutionary sequence of
                   increasing star formation activity with orbital
                   phase.},

  abstract =      {As a young massive cluster in the Central Molecular
                   Zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the
                   stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the extreme
                   Galactic Center environment. We use multi-epoch
                   Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain
                   high-precision proper motion and photometric
                   measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster
                   membership probabilities for stars down to 1.8
                   M$_{\odot}$ between cluster radii of 0.25 pc -- 3.0
                   pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just ~8% field
                   contamination, a significant improvement over
                   photometrically-selected samples which are severely
                   compromised by the differential extinction across the
                   field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy
                   of 5 cluster members, we forward model the Arches
                   cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other
                   properties (such as age and total mass) while
                   accounting for observational uncertainties,
                   completeness, mass segregation, and stellar
                   multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best
                   described by a 1-segment power law that is
                   significantly top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.03
                   (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys), where dN/dm $\propto$
                   m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment
                   power law model with a high-mass slope only slightly
                   shallower than local star forming regions ($\alpha$ =
                   2.10 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02) but with a break at
                   5.16$^{+1.25}_{-0.65}$ $\pm$ 0.08 M$_{\odot}$. In
                   either case, the Arches IMF is significantly
                   different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches
                   to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we
                   find tentative evidence for a systematically
                   top-heavy IMF at the Galactic Center.},
